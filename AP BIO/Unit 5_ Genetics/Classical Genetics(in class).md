Classical Genetics(in class)

# Genetics
### Mendel
 - Classical Genetics demonstrates what genetics is
 - Mendel is father of modern genetics, from hungary
 - Travelled to vienna to fail med school exam
 - Contintued working on farm, went to vienna to be priest, failed test
 - While in vienna, bishop offered mendel post as monk/gardener
	 - Noticed differences in plant colorations+sizes, wondered why
	 - Focused on pea plant
		 - Seven different identifiers
		 - Seed Shape, Seed Color, Flower color, Pod shape, Pod color, Flower position, Stem height
		 - Have only 6 chromosome, lucky that none of the identifiers were close to each other on chromosomes
		 - Hand-pollinated plants(Remove stamen, take polen w/paintbrush, put on stigma, get peas, plant them)(whole process takes two years)(now we have faster plants)
 - Terms
	 - Generations
	 - $P$-Generation(Parental)(purebreeding/truebreeding)
	 - $F_1$ generation(first filial)(offspring of parental)
	 - $F_2$ generation(2nd filial)($F_1$ offspring(most interesting))
	 ***
	 - Allelic terms
	 - All genes have 2 alleles
	 - Dominant Allele(Protein expressed)
	 - Recessive Allele(Protein muted by dom)
	 - Heterozygous(different)
	 - Homozygous(2x same)
		 - Recessive
		 - Dominant
	 - Traditionally use first letter of recessive allele
		 - Avoid certial letters at all costs(CcOoWwKkVv)
		 - Otherwise use a random letter but make sure you define its meaning
	 ***
	 - Genotype(Heterozygous or Homozygous dom/rec)
	 - Phenotype(physical outcome of genotypes/expressed protein)(Dominant or recessive)
		 - Homozyg dom or hetzyg, express same phenotype
 - Simple monohybrid cross/Law of Segregating Traits/Alleles
	 - One characteristic, dominant/recessive
	 - Assume P generation is purebreeding
		 - Red flower(RR) White Flower(rr)
		 - $F_1$ is all Rr(heterozygous)
		 - $F_2$ is RR, Rr, Rr, rr
	 - Have to segregate alleles
		 - Segregating RR to become haploid R and R
		 - Have to keep same number of Rs, RR+rr!->Rrr+R
	 - Mendel discovered each gamete had two traits, each seperated into seperate gametes
	 - Each gamete gets one chromosome/trait for a gene

	 - For punnet squares, in boxes is F2 Generation, outside is F1
	 - Report as ex: Phenotype, 3:1//Genotype 1:2:1
	 - Mendel would have dominant phenotype, dont know genotype
		 - Test/Back cross
		 - Cross with homozygous recessive
		 - If each F has dom phenotype, dominant phenotype was homozygous dom
		 - 1/2 offspring are dom, 1/2 rec, dom phen P was htzg
 - Dihybrid crosses
	 - End up w/ 4 diff gametes(4x4 box)
	 - Law of Independent Assortment(Alleles anre not linked to one another, so diff aleles have equal chance to end up in either gametes equally)
 - Sex-linked disorders
	 - In a problem, you have to account for individual's sex(usually carried on X, expressed in males more than females)
	 - Males do not have a backup copy of a wrong gene
	 - 5 diff genotypes
		 - Males: afflicted or normal(xy or x'y)(x' is mutated allele)
		 - Females: XX, X'X(carrier), X'X'(afflicted)
	 - Color-Blindness
		 - Complete colorblindness(dont see red or green, see grey)
		 - Other tests to determine things
	 - X'Y x XX
		 - Genotype: 2x X'X , 2x XY
		 - Males MUST have X chromosome from female
	 - Cross again X'Y x X'X: 
		 - Genotype: X'X', YX', X'X, XY
	 - **NOT IN POWERPOINT**
		 - X chromosomes: Muscular dystrophy, etc etc can only happen severly in females
	 - Men Cannot be carriers
	 - pedigrees
		 - Square rep Men
			 - Can never have half square
		 - Circ rep women
			 - Women die from hemophelia pefore puberty
			 - If female, have to be homozygous recessive for both alleles
	 - In mammalian females, one of the two X chromosomes in each cell is randomly inactivated during early embryonic development, becoming highly condensed into a Barr body.
 - Gene linkage
	 - Genes all anong a chromosome
	 - If a gene is close to anothere gene, can be hooked together, majority of offsring will take those alleles as a package
	 - In order to do a gene map, look at a three point cross
	 - Recombinants(have a lower phenotypic expression bc of crossover)
		 - In first miotic division w/ tetrad, Inside chromosomes tangle, cross over, crossing over increases diversity
		 - Chromosomes that cross over are recombinants
	 - Linkage studies used to determine Chromsoms makeup(gene map)
		 - Different combinations to the offspring
		 - Called a three point cross
		 - Look at differences btw parental gametes(haploids)
		 - Look at double crossover(single crossover does the crossing over swap thing)
	 - Percent of recombination is equal to map distance
		 - Look at double recombinance, can determine order of genes/etc
		 - Genes are close to eachother to see a double recombinant
		 - TPC are also good to determine distance btw genes
 - Chi Square test - Hypothesis-testing method
	 - Used a lot in genetics
	 - Look at phenotypic ratios
	 - AbBbxAaBb expected 9:3:3:1
	 - If actual is 1:1:1:1, prove is wrong using chi-square
		 - $\chi ^2 = \sum{(o-e)^2}/e$
		 - sum(observed-expected)^2/expected
	 - Degrees of freedom - number of independent factors/variables
		 - N(num of vars) - 1
	 - Responses on a sort of a bell curve
		 - Not significant
		 - Significant
		 - Determined by probability that value calculated lands on curve
	 - Null hypothesis is that it fits 9:3:3:1
	 - Alternative hypothesis is usually !Null
	 - If in significant difference, need to come up with another null hypothesis to determine fit
	 - Chi squared table, look under the correct DOF and .05, if number is less than number listed, accept hypothesis
 - Mitochandrial Inheritance
	 - Lot of info on mitochandria DNA
	 - Mitochandria DNA is circular(TRANSPOSONS)
	 - Much of mitochandria info has jumped to normal chromosomes
		 - Metabolic functions remain
		 - Mitochandrial diseases
	 - Mitochandrial diseases
		 - Mostly metabolic/processing issues
 - Somatic cells do mitosis(majority of cells)
	 - Outcome is 2 identical cells(diploid)
	 - Go thru M phase once(one of each phase)
 - Gamete-producing cells do meiosis(follicular(ovary) cells and intersitcial(teste) cells)
	 - Outcome is 4 nonidentical(haploid) cells
	 - Go thru M phase twice(two of all phases)
	 - First metaphase has tetrad of chromatids
		 - Instead of individual chromatids pulled apart, pairs pulled apart(crossing over/exchange)
