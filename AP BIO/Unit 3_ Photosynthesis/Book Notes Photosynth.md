## Chapter 10/Photosynth Book Notes
***
### Intro
 - Light from sun
 - Used in chloroplasts, makes organic molecules+O2
 - Organic Molecules+o2 used in plants+others for cell resp
 - Creates CO2 and H20, used in photosynth, cycles

### 10.1: Photosynthesis feeds the biosphere
 - Photosynthesis converts nrg of sun into chem nrg in sugars et al.
 - Photosynth feeds entire living world
	 - Autotrophs - "self-feeders", dont need other beings to sustain self
		 - Use CO2, other inorganic mats
		 - Almost all plants are autotrophs
		 - Plants are "Photoautotrophs"(use light nrg)
	 - Heterotrophs - "other feeders", incapable of making own food(consumers)
		 - Decomposers eat organic remains(fungi and many prokaryotes)
		 - All heterotrophs dependent on photoautotrophs

### 10.2: Photosynth convers light nrg into Chemical nrg in food nrg
 - Structure of infolded plasma membranes helps with this(endosymbiont)
 - Chloroplast structure
	 - Green
	 - Mainly found in mesophyll(interior leaf tissue)
	 - CO2 enters leaf, O2 exits by stomata
	 - Water enters from root veins up the stem(also carries sugar) to plant parts that dont produce own sugar
	 - Typical cell has 30-40 chloroplasts
	 - Chloroplast cytosol is called stroma
 - Tracking atoms thru photosynth
	 - Overall eq: $6CO_2+12H_2O+Light\ Energy \to C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2$
		 - H20 on both sides bc 12 consumed, 6 produced
		 - Can look at net eq, but...
 - Light reactions+Calvin cycle
	 - Light reactions oxidize water, Calvin cycle reduces co2
	 - Nrg from Light Reactions in form of NADPH & ATP go to calvin cycle
		 - Light reactions split H20 with light nrg, H accepted by NADP+, gains 2 e-
		 - Light reactions Make ATP with photophosphorylation of ADP
		 - Happens in thylakoid membranes
	 - Calvin cycle
		 - Takes CO2 from air, does carbon fixation to attach it to organic compounds
		 - Uses NADPH e- + ATP to fix
		 - Makes sugar
		 - Happens in stroma

### 10.3 Light reactions in Depth
 - What is light?
	 - Light is em radiation
	 - Visible light is most important to humans bc we see it, it does photosynth
	 - Shorter wavelength, greater energy of light(purp is short wave, high nrg)
 - How is light recieved by the plant
	 - Photosynthetic pigments absorb violet and red light
	 - Spectrophotometer measures how much light absorbed by something
	 - Absorption spectra for chlorophyl A, B show green light reflected
	 - Accessory pigments absorb some green light to make up for it
	 - Pigments have porphyn ring with Mg center(otherwise like hemoglobin), Hydrocarbon tail, differ by functional groups
	 - Chlorophyl d+f absorb lower nrg light(good for shady areas)
	 - Cartenois absorb violet+blue green light
		 - Cartenoids absorb + dissipate excessive light to prevent interaction w/ Chlorophyl A
 - What happens after light absorped
	 - Electron raised to a higher state
	 - Only photons absorbed which exactly provide enough nrg to raise electron
	 - Once in excited state, if in isolation, release nrg as heat+red light
 - How does the excited e- generate nrg
	 - Chloroplast structure useful
	 - Reaction-Center Complex
		 - Contains pigment+protein structures, light harvesting complexes
			 - consist of various pigments bound to proteins
			 - types of pigments allow for photosystem to have more light range
			 - Act as antenna to gather nrg for Reaction-center
			 - Light passed from pigment to pigment, reach chloroplyl A pair center, boost e- to higher orbital, transfer to primary electron acceptor(NADP)
		 - Photosystem 2 + 1 have different reaction-center complxes
			 - Photosystem II is P680(best for absorbing 680nm)
			 - Photosystem I is P700(best for absorbing 700nm)
			 - Similar in structure, but e- acceptor differs
 - How do the electrons flow to make NADPH+ATP(Linear flow)
1. Photon strikes PS II, e- is excited and as it falls back to ground, it raises another pigment's e-, continuing untill reaches P680 pair of chlorophyl As in the center
2. e- in P680 goes to primary e- acceptor, P680 becomes P680+
3. Water split into 2e-(one refills PS II, other step 4), 2H+(released into thylakoid interior, O(Forms O2)
4. Other e- goes thru ETC(similar to cell resp), carried by Pq(plastoquinone), Pc(plastocyanin), H+ sent to inside thylakoid, forms gradient
5. Gradient used to make ATP w/ chemiosmosis/ATP synthase
6. More sunlight in PS I excites P700 to P700+, accepts e- from ETC
7. Go down 2nd ETC thru Fd(Ferredoxin), no gradient, no atp
8. NADP+ reductase catalyzes e- from Fd into NADP+ forms NADPH, also removes H+ from stroma
 - Cyclic Flow
 - Uses PS I, not PS II
 - Circuit(e- in Fd to Cytochrome, to e- in Pc to P700)
	 - No NADPH Production
	 - No O2 given off
	 - Does generate ATP
 - Some Photosynthetic Bacteria only use one, some random organisims with both do ciclic
 - Chemiosmosis in chlorooplasts vs Mitochandria
	 - ETC passes e- thru proteins, each wanting the e- more
	 - Thus, Proton-Motive Pot. Nrg created
	 - ATP synthase phosphorlyates ADP
	 - Some proteins very similar ij MC+CP
	 - In CP, H+ come from water, MC, come from sugar
	 - Thylakoid space = IMF in MC

### 10.4 Calvin Cycle
 - Calvin + Krebs are similar, but not really
	 - Calvin is anabolic, makes sugar
	 - Krebs is catabolic, breaks down pyruvate
 - Calvin cycle makes G3P
 - For one G3P, cycle turns 3 times, fixes one CO2 per turn
 - Turn steps
	 - 3 CO2 +RuBisCo Enter
	 - Fixed into intermediate, 6C, 2P with RuBP by RuBisCo, then broken into 2x 3C, 1 P
	 - ATP enters, makes 2x 3C, 2 P
	 - NADPH enters, makes G3P and lose phosphate
	 - 1 G3P output
	 - 5 remaining G3P(over 3 turns)
		 - 2  make 3 ATP
		 - 3 recycled, restart cycle as RuBP(5C, 2 P)
 - Carbon fixation Phase
	 - attaches CO2 to RuBP catalyzed by rubisco
 - For one G3P, Calvin cycle eats 9 ATP, 6 NADPH
### 10.5 Carbon Fixation in Hot, Dry Climates
 - Plants that metaboliclly conserve water
 - balance photosynth and water loss
 - Gas comes and goes thru stomata normally
 - Is photoresp Out of date?
	 - In most plants, rubisco fixes carbon(C3 plants)
	 - Agricultural plants like rice, wheat, soy
	 - When stomata close on dry days, stomata closes to prevent water loss, less CO2, less sugar produced
	 - Rubisco is using O2 as CO2 goes away
	 - Product of rubisco+O2 is inviable, peroxisomes digest, spit out CO2
	 - This process is photorespiration, produces no sugar, decreases output bc releases CO2 that could be used
	 - This is innefficent, is evolutionary baggage, would have been better in atm w/ more CO2, less o2, less likely to happen
 - C4 and CAM plants have different approach
	 - Alternate carbon fixation
	 - Evoved seperately 45 times(SUPER EFFICENT)
	 - When hot and dry, stomata partially closes
	 - Sugar still made bc CO2 stored by PEP Carboxylase(makes 4C)(ex Malate)
	 - 4C moves to bundle-sheath cell, CO2 released int calvin cycle/Rubisco
	 - Mesophyll cells pump CO2 in bundle-sheath cells, keep CO2 lvl high enough
 - CAM Plants
	 - Cacti/Succulent plants Open stomata at night, close during day
	 - During night, make CO2 Storage compound
