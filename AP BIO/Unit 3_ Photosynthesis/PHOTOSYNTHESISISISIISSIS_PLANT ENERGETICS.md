## In-Class Photosynth Notes
***
### Photosynth
 - Anabolic reactions
 - Makes light nrg into chem nrg(glucose)
 - Use Chlorophyll to convert
 - Done in chloroplast
 - Similar to Hemoglobin(quatrenary protein)
 - Light independent reactions and light dependent

### Chlorophyll
 - Magneseum center(iron is i hemoglobin)
 - Botanists can seperate parts of chlorphyl, distinguish btw 5 diff ABCDE
 - BCDE are accessory pigments
 - All plants + some cyanobacteria have Chlorophyl A
 - Can ID phylum of plants based on type of chlorphyls present
 - Chlorophytes(3:1)
	 - Chlorophyl A primary pigment(3)
	 - Chlorophyl B acessory pigment(1)
 - Chlorpholyl 
	 - B has ketone gp in place where A has methyl gp
	 - C found in chysophytes(golden algae)(A:C, 3:1)
	 - D+E Accessory pigments found in small concentrations only
	 - Absorps Light
		 - Light has many diff wavelengths
		 - Chlorphyls accept visible lights only(except 500-600green)
		 - Chlorophyl A+B+C good at getting blue light bc its HIGH ENERGY LIGHT
		 - Chlorophyl A+B good at getting red light too just to get as much as possible/use all sun
		 - C has negligible red absorpance
	 - Chlorophyl system structure
		 - Accessory pigments picks up the segments of light that Chlorophyl A cant take
		 - By the time light reaches the center(Chlorophyl A), all the same wavelengths
		 - Leaves turn colors bc they have other pigments that when the green stuff denature, there are diff colors behind them
		 - As long as light is good quality(brightness), chlorophyl works 
	 - Chloroplast structure
		 - One of 2 organelles that have >1 plasma membrane(also mitochandria)
		 - Techincally have 3 membranes(outer, inner surround third set) third set are thylakoids
		 - Thyklakoids stacked like pennies into a grana(penny roll)
		 - Stromal thylakoids connect grana
		 - Liquid surrounding grana is stroma(acidic/high H+ ion concentration)
		 - Plant cells each have multiple chloroplasts(massive)
		 - In ceritan organisims(mostly without cuticle), different shape chloroplasts, alters shape to absorb absorp light -- all plants have some method of doing this intensities(rotate to prevent burning)

### Youtube videos on photosynth
 - Photosynth gives o2 and food
 - found in laces other than plant
 - Happens in eukarotyic cells in chlooplast
	 - Thylakoid membrane(pancake)
	 - Stack of thylakouids is grana
	 - liquid suspending grana is stroma, 
 - Leaf has many different molecules to absorb diff wavelengths
	 - Chloroplyll A,B dont absorp green
	 - Black would make them too hot
 - Water+CO2+light -> C6H12O6+6O2
 - 2 steps Photo(light), and Synthesis(to make)
 - Light reactions and Calvin cycle
 - Calvin cycle takes place in stroma
 - Light dependent
	 - Produces O2, NADPH, ATP
	 - O2 waste
	 - NADPH, ATP go to calvin cycle, make CO2 into glucose
	 - Closer look
		 - Proteins with chlorophyl in thykaloid membrane(photosystem)
		 - light used to power ETC, ETC powered by light
		 - Protons pumped to inside of limen
		 - Electrons provided by H20
		 - Opposite of cell resp
		 - Go through ATP Synthase, make ATP
	 - Calvin cycle
		 - RUBP joins with CO2 by RuBisCo(1C), splits into 2 3 carbons
		 - Made into G3P, Much released, much becomes RUBP
		 - Photorespiration(if not enough CO2)
			 - O2 jumps into calvin cycle, gatehrs with rubisco, makes useless molecule
			 - In 3C plants, o2 respiration bad, shuts down system
			 - Might not have CO2 if too hot, stomata closes to prevent water loss
		 - in CAM Plants(pineapple)
			 - only open stomata at night, store CO2 in vacoules as malic acid at cold night
			 - C4 Plants make CO2 molecule into C4 to store, use

### Light dependent/independent reactions
 - Both in chloroplast
 - Products exported into cytoplasm
 - Light depentent
	 - Light powers this
	 - This powers everything else
	 - Need photosystems for light to work
		 - Light nrg concentrated in photosystems
		 - Light excites electrons(similar to ETC)
		 - Excited e- form with NADP+
		 - 2 sub-reactions(simultaneous)
		 - Cyclic Photophosphorylation
			 - electrons are cycled
			 - proteins all in thylakoid membranes
			 - To PHOTOSYSTEM 1(P700), discovered first, happens second
			 - Chlorophyls is at center(CHA at center, accessories around)
			 - Light enters as nrg photons(all wavelengths)
			 - Strikes reaction center, greens reflected, everything else filtered toward Chlorophyl A, gets closer to 700nm
			 - Excites 2 e-
			 - Form NADPH from NADP
			 - e- cycled through cytochrome proteins(similar to ion pumps in mitochandria ETC)
			 - Increase proton gradient on thylakoid membrane
			 - Protons used in ATP Synthase(same as in MC)
			 - Q protein also pumps
			 - Takes place all the time(but mostly when CO2 lvls low)
			 - Photosystem 1 recycles e- from cytochrome system through itself
		 - Non-Cyclic Photophosphorylaton
			 - Water split into 2e-, 2h+, 1O(Oxygen joins with other make O2)
			 - Photosystem 2(P680) moves e-, excited by light, into cttochrome system
			 - Photosystem 1(p700) moves e-, excited by light, into cytochrome system
			 - makes ATP, NADPH, H+
			 - Where to next???
 - Light independent
	 - Calvin Cycle(C3 Photosynth)(used by most land plants/dichots)
		 - uses 6 ATP, 6NADPH
		 - Takes 3 RuBP, puts into RuBISCO(Ribulose Bisphophate Carboxylase Oxidase)
		 - RyBISCO adds CO2 onto RuBP, forms 3x6C compound(highly unstable)
		 - Breaks into 6 PGA(3C), phosphorlyated, reduced into G3P
		 - G3P does reverse glycolysis, makes sugar
		 - G3P becomes DHAP, used in Fatty Acid creation
		 - G3P can be used to make any macromolecule
		 - Intermediates used for many other things
		 - Each turn creates 1 G3P, exported into cytoplasm, then to floem
		 - in flowem, Reverse glycolysis makes G3P into Glucose
		 - Glucose moved with H+ into flowm and into root for storage
	 - Alternatives to Calvin cycle
		 - Plants that have to conserve water
			 - succulents/CAM(cactus, aloe, etc)
			 - C4 plants(Grasses/monocots)
		 - Light dependent is same
		 - Difference in how CO2 is incorperated
		 - C3, CO2, immediately used
		 - In C4, CO2 stored
			 - Light depentent takes place in mesophyll
			 - PEP(phospho-enyl-pyruvate)(3C) produced in mesophyl
			 - Uses one CO2, forms Malate, stores
			 - Bundle sheet cells take malate, decarboxylate Malate
			 - CO2 goes into calvin cycle, PEP goes back to get more
			 - Conserves water
		 - CAM plant
			 - Only diff is that CO2->Malate happens @ night
			 - CO2 taken in @ night thru stomata, stored
 - Plant Anatomy
	 - Flowering plants are Dicots or Monocots
	 - cot = cotyleden = baby plant's leaf
		 - dicot - 2 baby leafs(dandilion)(branching veins)(multiples of 4-5 petals)(taproots)
		 - monocot - 1 baby leaf(grass)(parallel veins)(multiples of 3 petals)(branching roots)
	 - Shoots(above ground)
		 - Shoot nodes are places where branch out
		 - internodes are spaces btw branches
	 - Roods(below ground)
	 - Tissues
		 - Dermal(epidermis/outer lining cells, periderm cells/bark)(protection, prevent water loss)
			 - Epiddermis(leaf cross section)
			 - makes up leaf structure, gaurd cells, waxy cuticle
		 - Ground(Parenchyma, Chllenchyma, Schlerenchyma)(metabolisim, storage, growth)
			 - majority parenchyma cells(photosynth)
			 - Collenchyma(durable support cells)
			 - Schlerenchyma(sueor durable(big fibers/protect seesds, stem)
		 - Vascular(xylem+phloem)(transport)
			 - Xylem(water)
			 - Phloem(sugar)
	 - Primary growth(up and down)
		 - apical meristem(just replicate cells)
		 - root meristems grow with ends capped
	 - Secondary growth(bark/widening)
		 - produce more xylems and phloems
		 - Vascular camblum makes xylems and phloems
		 - Cork cambium makes corx/bark on outside
	 - Why rings?
		 - summer, grow quickly, diffent concentrations diff colors
	 - Flower
		 - Stamen head = anther, makes sperm/pollen(male)
		 - Ovule surrounded by ovary
		 - double fertilizations
			 - pollen moves into ovule
			 - 3female polar neucleui attach to sperm(triploid)
			 - acttual egg+sperm join(diploid)
			 - triploid becomes endosperm/food for diploid
