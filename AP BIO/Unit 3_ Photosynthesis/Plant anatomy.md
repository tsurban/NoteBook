## In-Class Plant Anatomy notes
***
### Photorespiration/O2 problem
 - When O2 gets caught in C3, go thru Photorespiration cycle
 - Happens more in C3 bc Only one CO2/ more seperated from RuBisCo
 - RuBisCo hooks O2 to rubp, changes pathway entirely
 - Makes amino acids(glycine and serine)+G3P+other useful things
 - Plant can use this
 - C4 and CAM plants go through this process less frequently than C3(25% in C3)/wasted nrg
 - C3 plants are less efficent at fixing carbon
	 - Evolution says C3 plants should be elim.
	 - Not true(most flowering plants C3)
	 - Must be no selective pressure for C3 plants
 - Process evolved sans O2, now that there is, they have this other cycle
 - C4/CAM plants hold water, only open at night, less o2 to get involved
 - Buliform cells filled with water at start of day, stop photorespiration when empty/dry @ night
 - C4/CAM plants manage o2 much better

### Glyoxylic pathway
 - happens in the spring
 - Seeds germinating
 - Seeds are mostly fatty acids(shiny)
 - Seed has to convert fatty acids to usable nrg
 - Glyoxylic cycle does this
	 - Beta oxidation breaks down fatty acids
	 - Broken into Acetyl(2C) groups
	 - Hooked to COA, to glyoxix acid to malic acid 
	 - Malic acid goes into calvin/krebs cycle, get glucose
	 - Glucose goes thru glycolysis
	 - Malic acid can go to Mitochandria, krebs cycle
	 - Takes place in glyocisome/similar to peroxisome
 - Nuts have so much stuff bc they have to have EVERYTHING to sprout

### Cellular Energetics
 - Relationship btw photosynth and cell resp
 - Plants have both chloroplast and MC
 - G3P is the one common link between the process(most important step)
 - G3P can become many things

### Anerobic Respiration
 - Many organisims dont have access to O2(bottom of ocean, pond muck)
 - Glycolysis, Krebs, ETC, but final e- acceptor not O
	 - Sulfur can be used(same group as o2)
	 - Form H2S or hydrogen sulfide(rotten eggs)
	 - Form in hot springs/mud
	 - Sulfate reducing bacteria(add H2 to sulfur)
	 - Sulfur accessable in ocean bc ocean vents excrete SO2, break down into S and O2
	 - Use O2 in other things(amino acids/etc)
	 - use S as final e- acceptor
	 - CO2 is reduced to methane(O used for amino acids and stuff)
	 - 
 - No photorespiration or anything with light in deep ocean
	 - Bacteria use chemicals in place of sun, are producers
	 - Tube worms eat bacteria 
	 - Basically totally different trophic pyramid

### Anabolic Production
 - Carbs
	 - Glucose produced from G3P/reverse glycolysis, 
	 - Get glucose, glycogen, starch, cellulose
	 - In bacteria, peptidoglycan made from fructose in glyc
 - Fatty acid
	 - Reverse Beta oxidation
	 - Sticks acetyl groups back together(makes amino acids)
	 - Get DHAP, used to convert to glycerol/triglycerides
 - Amino Acid
	 - Intermediates of krebs
	 - Oxylacedic acid+amine group-animation->move amine froups to amino acids
 - Neucleic acids
	 - Pentose pathway
 - Each organisim produces some if not all of them
	 - Plants All
	 - Animals Most/eat food(essential nutrients)
	 - Algae/Lower animals can produce all

## Plant science
 - frequently shows up on AP
 - Chap 29, 30, 35
 - Different tissues like in humans
 - Growth, Structure, Vascular Tissues
 - Grouth tissues become structural and vascular tissues
 - Plant cells divide once, then stop
 - growth tissues continue division(most plant cells only divide once or is dead tissue)
 - Bark is only living part of a tree(center is dead)
### Growth Tissues
 - Apical Meristem(roots and chutes)
	 - Allows plant to grow up and down
	 - Also at tips of branches
	 - Anything @ end of line
	 - Roots
		 - Zone of cell division(zone of mytotic activity)
			 - Some vasucar tissue
			 - Cells undergo single cell division
			 - Zone of elongation
			 - In elongation zone, acid growth hypothesis, cell pumps electrolytes to btw cell wall+plasma membrane
			 - Acids stretch things(becomes hypertonic, water moves in, stretches, electrolytes neutralized, cells stops growing)
		 - Soil-side, root cap, cells fall off as root goes further(like skin)
 - Vascular Meristem/Cambian
	 - Produces xylem+phloem
	 - Xylem(roots to leaves) Phloem(Leaves to roots)
	 - Once Xylem divides, neucleus dies, is hollow
	 - Phloem is alive
	 - Herbacious plants don't have woody stems(annuals)
 - Woody plants also have lateral meristem
	 - Produce protective material+cork
	 - All trees have cork
	 - Cork trees have really big cork
	 - protocambian
 - Root caps
	 - Root cap produces significant CO2
	 - Helps roots grow down
	 - Water+CO2->Carbonic Acid
	 - This is why rain is acidic
	 - Carbonic acid is mildly acidic, breaks down soil
 - Shoot
	 - Same structures
	 - Apical meristem
		 - Procambian(begennigs of xylem and phloem)
		 - ground meristem produces cap-kind of
		 - protoderm = infant cortex cells
		 - primordia = begennings of buds + leaves
	 - Apical meristem is always where bud produced+always in all roots
	 - Lateral meristem
		 - Vascular meristem
		 - Gives rise to xylem+phloem
		 - Everything outside of vascular cambium is phloem(living)
		 - On inside is xylem(dead)/hollow
			 - primary xylem(og xylem plant starting to grow)
			 - Everything else is 2ndary xylem
			 - peice of wood is all xylem
			 - In woody dicots,xylems in groups formed on either half of vascular cambium
			 - inside of vascular cambium is pith
			 - Eventually pith becomes hart wood
			 - pith is storage place for nutrients, enzymes, etc
			 - Other side is phloem
			 - Everythign between vascular cambium and epidermis is all living(phloem+cortex)
		 - Most trees also have cork cambian
			 - Builds cork layer
			 - in semi-desert climates, drought tolerant trees w/cork
			 - Most trees have small cork layers produced by cork cambina
			 - in portugal/iberian peninsula, cork trees produce more layers
	 - Meristem tissue does undergo mitosis(mitotically active part of plant)
 - Other tissues
 - Structural tissues
	 - Parenchyma
		 - basic generic tissue
		 - Sometimes storage
		 - in leaves, is mesophyll(photosynthetic)
		 - Makes up cortex in woody dicots
	 - Sclerenchyma tissue(stronger than col)
		 - Support monocot vascular tissue and in dicot seeds
		 - Produced, then loses all cellular components
		 - strengthens other tissues
		 - Called stone cells
		 - Also found in seeds of stone fruits(peach/cherries/avacado)
	 - Collenchyma
		 - cell walls thinner than scleren
		 - located in epidermis in mono+dicots
		 - may or may not have cytoplasm
	 - Chlorenchyma
		 - photosynthetic
		 - not recognized anymore
		 - basically mesophyl tissue
 - Non-Meristematic Tissue
	 - Plant fibers
	 - Make Grains
	 - Make little tubes to conduct resin/sap
	 - Support mechanisim in trees
	 - Mostly inflexible
	 - Conduct electricity bc lotsa water
 - Vascular tissue
	 - 2 types
	 - Either vessels(pine trees)
	 - Trachids(non pine trees)
	 - SLIDE(a,b vessls/civ plates/constant flow moving up/prevents air bubbles with grate)(c-e trachids in angiosperms/flowering plants/no grates, many little holes/pits to break up air)
	 - Bundles
		 - eyes, mouth, nose are xylem
		 - look at slides
	 - Phloem
		 - actual living tissue
		 - (xylem loses cytoplasm)
		 - Living tissue side of vascular cambium
		 - phloem made of 2 diff cells
			 - civ tube cell w/vessels
			 - companion cell regulating everything in civ tube cell
			 - Excess sugar from photosynth goes into phloem, redistributed to where needed
			 - companion cell redirects sugar
 - Acedemic opportunity ends w/ vascular tissues
 - Monocots usually annual bc vascular cambian dosen't keep reproducing(Randomly distributed)

### Leaves
 - C3 leaf vs C4(cam similar) leaf
 - note: more/better light in tropics bc the atmosphere has to deflect the light less
 - C3
	 - C3 most frequently falling down leaves
	 - Top layer is cuticle, waterproofing layer, waxy, produced by leaf(G3P->DHAP->Fatty Acids), thicker in tropics(more water loss bc plants evolve to use more water, cant lose as much)
	 - Below that is epidermis
	 - below that is palisade mesophyll(parenchyma cells)
		 - palisades means vertical/perp to epidermis
		 - whole layer of cells in line with sunlight, more surface area, better photosynth
		 - in tropics, have multiple layers of palisade mesophyl(better light)
	 - Spongy mesophyl(parenchyma)
		 - Has air spaces(sub-stomatal crypt)
			 - also layer thin of water surrounding cells
			 - co2 and o2 go between these cells, obey gas laws
			 - Law of partial pressures, so cant survive in pure o2 bc cant move co2 around
		 - Where gas exchange takes place
		 - Stomata(opening) and guard cells(control opening) control this
		 - on a dicot leaf(but not waterlilies), stomata on bottom epidermis
	 - Lower epidermis has thin cuticle as well
	 - Bundle sheath mostly structural
 - C4
	 - Photosynthetic cells are mesophyl cells where light collected, CO2 is fixed, calvin cycle occurs in bundle sheath cells
	 - stomata on both surfaces
	 - Also have bolate cells on epidermis, 3 parenchyma cells
		 - Start out day filled w/ water
		 - water moved into mesophyl 4 photosynth
		 - Leaf starts to curl bc change water(crab grass)
		 - leafs dont do photosynth anymore, prevent from burning up/drying out
	 - Guard cells
		 - Osmotic principles
		 - Stomata is hole regulated in size by guard cell(behind stomata is crypt)
		 - Malate transported w/ K+ to gaurd cell(active transport), causes ion imbalance
		 - Causes water to move into cells(CELL is hypertonic)
		 - Opens stomata bc cell swells
		 - inner layer of cell not very flexible, so swells up to make opening
		 - k+ leaks out, malate is used by photosynth(calvin cycle), hole closes
		 - Environmental cues for opening+closing
			 - Opening at dawn triggered by light
			 - CO2 deblletion
			 - Circadian rhythym(in plants is light dominated)
			 - High temperatures close stomata bc lose water
			 - Absicic acid (plant hormone) produced bc lack of water, closes stomata
			 - Backwards for cam plants(open @ night) bc water
### Roots
 - Anchor plant to substrate
 - Primary source of nutrients
 - Soils low in nutrients have adapted roots
 - Apical meristem
	 - pictured is monocot
	 - See mature xylem(in cross)+phloem(in arms of cross)
	 - Vascular stele surrounded by endodermis(waterproofed by casparian strip)
	 - Casparian strip lets water, nutrients in, only lets starches out into cortex
 - Zone of maturation 
	 - Root hairs(extenstions of epidermis)
		 - Incredibly fragile
		 - Usually when u pull a plant up, lose root hairs
		 - Increases surface area for mineral+nutrient absorption
		 - Lot of energy expended in root hair to transport nutrients
		 - Mostly facilitated diffusion, osmosis
		 - As soil drys out, water around roots gone, more air spaces
			 - all plants have fundamental minimum of water needed(permenant wilting point)(point when water in soil when water is so low plants never come back)
		 - Field capacity for water
			 - if all air spaces filled up, cannot hold more water, then makes runoff
	 - Water+minerals move into cortex cells thru osmosis+facillitated diffusion
		 - Get into vascular stele, xylem+phloem(apoplastic movement)
	 - Alternately moves around cortex cells(sim-plastic movement)
 - Root types
	 - Fiborous/Diffuse roots (C4) Pictured left 
		 - Better at retaining soil
		 - Grass good for growing near eroding places
	 - Adventitious/brace roots, grow up(ivy)
	 - Taproots(C3)(Right)
		 - Branches off of them called lateral roots
		 - Lateral roots produced by perry cycle
		 - After long time, lateral roots resemble diffuse roots
		 - Equal surface area to above ground, trees have taproots, grow in weird formations bc follow earth
		 - Taproots have same width as tree trunk
	 - Moss has root-like system(rhizomes), short, small tissues anchor plant to substrate
		 - moss can grab a lot of substrate
		 - Moss can build better substrate for future plants
		 - Taproots theoretically like mirror image to above ground tree
 - Plant growth(dg/dt)
	 - Growth of seed
	 - glyoxysosomes convert fatty acids to sugar
	 - Little white spot in bean is embryo(dicots)
		 - radical grows from there, becomes roots
			 - sprouts, bends down bc gravity+hormones
		 - Hypotococtyal(coleoptile)(apical meristem) grows from WHERE???, becomes stem
			 - Bends upward bc sunlight+hormones
			 - Breaks thru soil with seed, begins leaves
		 - cotyledens are old and wrinkly bc glyocysomes extracted all faty acids
		 - Below cotyleden is hypocotyl, above is epicotyl
	 - Monocot
		 - Still have embryo(in corn, at point of corn)
		 - Still have radical to produce roots
		 - bc cotlyeden stays in place, stem called coleoptile, unfolds into leaf
	 - Seed sprout if warm enough, water is avalible
	 - Also controlled hormonally
		 - phytoestrogens allow for cellular growth
		 - if in large concentrations, can have negative effect (excessive growth) in animals(frequently produced by water plants, animal consumes water etc.)
		 - Tropism is response resulting in organs moving away from or toward a stimulus(can have + or - response)
			 - Darwin+Son expiremetned on phototropism(plant response to light)
			 - Saw grass seedling grow toward light if only coleophtile is present
			 - developed words without knowing abt hormones
			 - Positive response is taxic response
			 - Negative response is nasty response
			 - Phototaxic means is attracted to light
			 - Photonasty means is avoiding light
		 - Plants produce hormones in low concentrations(very responsive to hormone)
		 - Responses are everything a plant does(division, elongation, etc)
		 - Plants have many hormones
	 - Hormone that causes photonasty/taxic is Auxin
		 - causes cell to grow or not(acid growth hypothesis)
		 - in radical, auxins pool on lower side bc gravity
		 - higher concentrations inhibit elnogation down, plant grows up
		 - if on upper side, lower concentration, cells elongate and root points down(gravity)
	     - in hypocotyl, low concentrations inhubit cell elongation
		 - Larger concentrations towards light, not inhibited
		 - Works by stimulating(or not) proton pumps creating gradient
		 - Auxin also alters geneexpression, stimulates a sustained growth
		 - Removal or addition of too much auxin kills plant
		 - Stimulates growth in lower branchses
		 - controls arrangement of leaves on stem
		 - Directs leaf vein patterns
		 - vascular combium controlled by auxin
		 - Auxin as herbicide
			 - IBA stimulates adventitious roots, stimulates cuttings
			 - Overdose of IBA can kill dicots(agent orange)
	 - Cytokinins stimulate cell division
		 - active in roots, shoots, fruits
		 - works with auxins
		 - can slow plant aging by inhibiting protein breakdown, stimulating rna and protein synth
	 - Gibberellins
		 - sensitive to water and soil temp
		 - stimulates glyoxysome to start plant growth
		 - in stems, also help stimulate cell division+elongation
		 - after contacting water, gibberellins released, signal germination
	 - Stems
		 - Arise from shoots
			 - in dicot comes from hypocotyl
			 - In monocot comes from coleopile
			 - Cotlyeldens(food go with stem as it grows)
			 - Eventually leaves bud out, unfurl, then cotyledens not needed for food
			 - Once cotyledens fall off, epi/hypo stem become integrated into stem
			 - Leaves come from apical meristem/basically modified parencyma tissue
		 - Plumule
			 - Epicotyls - Stem
			 - Leaf Primordia - Leaf
			 - Apical meristem - Parenchyma
		 - Stem Consists of 
			 - Alternating system of nodes/points where leaves were attached
			 - Plant+leaf begin building up cellulose to make cell wall, eventually leaves scar, where leaf attached, called node
			 - Node can have 2 or three leaf scars on opposite sides of stem(opposite leaf arangement)
			 - Little white bumps on stem are lenticiles for gas exchange all along twig(lose when get bigger bc needs less o2)
			 - Axilary buds form on sides of twig, have potential to become branch
			 - Apical/terminal buds are at end
			 - Vascular bundle scars formed when leaf broken off bc tree scabs over the bundles to prevent nutrient loss
			 - Alternate leaves are when angle of leaves shifts to be perpendicular to previous leaf set(1 scar per node)
			 - Distance between each node is called internode
			 - Opposite nodes are when one node has 2 scars on either side of the twig(2 scars per node)
			 - When Nodes scar with many right next to each other, it is whorled(2+ scars per node)
	 - Water transport
		 - Uses osmosis
		 - Area of low concentration to high solute concentration
		 - Water potential is measurement combining solute concentration and pressure
			 - Deterimens direction of movement of water
			 - $\Psi$ is measure of pressure across membrane
			 - Flows fromhigher water potential to lower water potential
			 - Potential is capacity to do work
			 - water potential is abbreviated as $\Psi$ in megapascals(MPa)
			 - $\Psi$ = 0MPa for pure water at Std temp+sea lvl
		 - Equation
			 - Water potential affected by pressure and solute concentration
			 - Expressed by $\Psi = \Psi_s+\Psi_p$
			 - $\Psi_s$ is solute potential is proportional to molarity
			 - Solute potential is also called osmotic potential
			 - $\Psi_p$ is pressure potential is physical pressure on solution
		 - Turgor Pressure is pressure by plasma membrane against cell wall+cell wall against protoplast
			 - Seen by water exiting cell
			 - Cell is hypertonic, water flows in, measuring pressure of water on cell wall/moving of water back out to prevent bursting thru aquaporins
			 - cell can drown bc loses ions in pumping out water
		 - Efficent long distance transport driven by pressure
			 - This is how plants move water from roots to vascular steele
			 - transport water across cortex, move using small amounts of pressure SYMPLASITC
		 - At vascular steele
			 - Outer layer(outside of vascular steele) is endodermis(where paras cycle and lateral roots)
			 - diffuses into vascular steele thru endodermis, cant go out bc blocked by casparian strip
			 - Pressure created bc water cant go out, so it must go up(root pressure)
	 - Transpiration
		 - Evaporation of water from stomata
		 - In cojuunction with root pressure, pulls water up(massive concentration gradient)
		 - Capilary pressure/adhesion+cohesion/cohesion tension hypothesis
		 - Xylem sap is normally under negative pressure/tension
		 - if you remove phloem, water still pumped up, strip bark
- Stuff going down(pressure flow hypothesis)
	- Active transport of water and photosynate into xylem
	- works with coheson-tension hypothesis
	- Cotransport of sugars(sucrose)
	- h+ ion attached to sucrose(cotransport molecule) put into phloem
	- angeosperms, seive-tube elements are conduits for translacation
		- Phloem sap is sucrose solution from leavees
		- Sugar source is net producer of sugar(mature leaves)
		- Sugar sink is organ that is net consumer or storage of sugar like tuber or bulb
	- Phloem is living; how sugars move, how pick up H+ is all regulated by companion cell
	- Process starts in leaves, is called phloem loaded
		- Phloem loaded with sucrose +cotransporter
		- then pushed down phloem into roots(phloem is hypotonic), water moves in, pushes sucrose+H+ down bc h+ prevents from leaving
	- once gets to roots, h+ detached, sucrose goes into cells, water recycled
### Boesman info
 - Water potential allows us to figure out if water will flow 
 - $\Psi$ is symbol
 - Osmosis
	 - adding solute to solution decreases water potential by making more space bc water attracted to solute
	 - Water flows from high to low potential
	 - Flows up tree (roots -2 bars, stems -6 bars, leaves -15, atmosphere -1000)
	 - Water evaporated as move up in leaves
	 - $\Psi_s$ water flowing by osmosis, drops with added solutes
	 - $\Psi_p$ is physical pressure, pressure of wall on membrane+vice versa, pressure potential, is positive/water pushed out
	 - $\Psi_T = \Psi_s+\Psi_p$
	 - $\Psi_s = -iCRT$
		 - $i$ is ionization consant(NaCl=2, Sucrose=1)(breaks apart so we multiply)
		 - $C$ is concentration(moles/liter)(molarity)
		 - $R$ Pressure constant(.0831 liter bars/mole K)
		 - $T$ is temperature, molecules bounce around more(kelvin)
		 - Overall water potential is $(\Psi_s = iCRT)+(\Psi_p= 0 \ bc\  open beaker)$
 - KISH AGAIN
 - Reproduction in plants
	 - Cover entire spectrum of both sexual and asexual methods(diff plants do diff things)
	 - Process of reproduction in plants is similar to in animals
		 - Female gamete production is different
		 - Different cells to produce each
	 - Special cells produce gametes at different times of year
		 - Like some rodents
	 - Most plants obey alternation-of-generation
		 - Alter between haploid(single chromosome set) and diploid(double chromosome set stages
		 - Haploid are mostly gametes
			 - Gametophyte generation
		 - Diploid is mostly adult plants
			 - Sporophyte generation
	 - in ferns, spores produced(little brown dots)
	 - Some plants are just haploid(algae)(no land plants)(plants and cyanobacteria and some singlecelled protists)
	 - If dominant spore generation, life cycle is diplohaplonitc(most common generation/dominant generation is diploid)(oak, maple, most plants)
	 - if  opposite, haplodiplonitc(only mosses)
	 - We will consider only reporduction in more common plants like flowers
	 - 2 types of gamete producing cells
		 - Microspore mother cells
		 - Megaspore mother cells
		 - microspore mother cells produce pollen(male sperm/smaller)
		 - Megaspore mother cells produce egg(larger)
		 - Microsporogenesis
			 - Where microspore mother cell meisois devodes forms 4 pollen
			 - Each plant species produces different shape
			 - To produce male gametes is similar to all other male gamete production
		 - Megasporogenesis
			 - Plant ovaries produce many different ovuleles
			 - in each ovulele multiple potential eggs
			 - White part of inside of pepper is placenta, all little seeds found in ovule
			 - Entire pepper is ovary
			 - A lot of ovules produced
			 - Each ovule has megaspore mother cell
			 - Megaspore mother cell devides by meiosis(produces for haploid cells)
			 - 3 haploid cells reabsorbed(akin to polar bodies)
			 - 1 cell divides 3x, forming 8 haploid cells
			 -	3 at bottom, 2 in middle of seed, 3 at top
			  - 1 of 3 at bottom is egg, others are supporting synergids
			  - Polar neuclei are in middle, will be fertilized(once fertilized middle becomes triploid and becomes cotyleden)
			  - Synergids and antipodals get reabsorped by plant, dont do anything
			  - Illustrates randomness of DNA transfer bc lots of mixing up before fertilized
		 - pollen
		 - Flowers
			 - Gametophyte generation(gamete producing)
			 - Male part is stamen
			 - Stamen contains anther(contains microspore mother cells)(supported by filament)
			 - Female part is pistil, made up of stigma at top, then style, then ovary
			 - If flower has both male and female parts, perfect flowers
			 - If have petals and sepals and stamens and pistil then complete flower
		 - Reproduction in angiosperms
			 - pollen lands on stigma somehow, grows pollen tube 
			 - Stigma is specie specific, pollen from other plant cant fertilize one plant
			 - Plants will dissolve and kill any nonfriendly pollen grain
			 - Pollen grain sprouts, tube neucleus starts producing pollen tube
			 - In angeosperms, pollen tube production is fast
			 - Grows thru style into ovule, sperm neuclei released, then fertilization happens
			 - in pine tree, takes 2 years(gets neucleus after 1 year, 2 for pine seed to develop)
			 -
