## Questions
 - 52.1Describe key factors that affect Earth's climate and explain how they influence climate patterns at different scales.

 - 52.2Identify terrestrial biomes and how their location and characteristics are influenced by climate and disturbance.

 - 52.3Identify the dominant zones and biomes in aquatic systems and their principal biological attributes.

 - 52.4Explain how the distribution of species is limited by biotic and abiotic factors.

 - 52.5Describe how ecological change and evolution affect one another over short and long periods of time.

### 52.1: Earth's climate vaires by latitude and season and is changing rapidly
 - Climate(long-term weather conditions) is the most significant influence on the distribution of organisms on land
	 - Key factors: Temp, Precipitation, Sunlight, Wind
 - Climate patterns largely dietermined by solar energy input and earth's movement in space
	 - Sun warms atmosphere, land, water
	 - Temp variations, air and water movements established to regulate
	 - Also cause dramatic latitudinal climate variations
 - Seasonality
	 - In middle-high latituted,s, seasons produced bc tilted axis and revolution about sun
	 - Changing angle of the sun alters angles of wet and dry air around equator(wet/dry seasons)
 - Bodies of Water
	 - Ocean currents change temp of air passing over land
	 - High specific heat of water means water generally moderates demp
 - Mountains
	 - When warm air hits a mountain, it rises and cools, descends on other side as cooler dry air(makes rain shadow)
	 - Also affect thru sunlight(south-facing slopes get more sunlight than north-facing, are warmer)
	 - Influences species locally
	 - Northern gyres flow clockwise, southern gyres flow counterclockwise

### Effects of Vegetation on Climate
 - esp in forests
 - Forest absorbs more light than desert or grassland, adds to warming of surface in forested areas
 - More than offset by transpiration(plant sweat)
 - Forests reduce earth's temp and increase percip rates

### Microclimate
 - Casting shade, altering evaporation, changing wind patterns
 - Forest trees moderate climate
 - Cleared areas have larger temp extremes
 - Low ground usually wetter than higher

### Global Climate Change
 - Any large sphere change in earths climate affects the biosphere
 - Fossil Fuel burning and deforestation add co2 to atmosphere
 - Climate change is a directional change in the global climate which lasts three decades or more
 - Changes expected to be similar to last ice age->now
 - Glaciers retreat, trees expand nirthward
 - Plants+Animals will move north to stay in same climate, somw will go extinct
	 - 22 of 35 european butterfly species shifted north recently
	 - 200 plants have moved to lower elevations bc less rain at higher elecations

## Biomes are controlled by climate and disturbance
 - Importance of climate on biome distribution visualized thru climograph(plot of percipitation and temperature) in world
	 - These graphs are based on averages
	 - Patterns of rain/temp are also important to what life a biome supports
 - Presence of seasons can influence what biome something is

### General feature of earth biomes
 - Mostly named for climatic features and vegetation
	 - Terrestrial biomes usually blend with nearby other biomes(overlap area is ecotone)
 - Vertical layering
	 - Canopy of forest, low-tree layer, shrub understory, ground layer, forest floor(litter layer), root layer
	 - Nonforests have less pronounced layers
 - Species composition varies btw biome
	 - In northern coniferous forest/taiga in north america has red spruce in east, not many other places(more white and black spruce)
	 - Plants in different places can converge thru evolution(NA cactus resemble Africa Euphorbs)

### Disturbance and Terrestrial Biomes
 - Disturbance is more common than stability(storm, fire, human activity)
	 - Canges community
	 - Removes organisims and alters resource ability
	 - Hurricanes open opportunity for new species in tropical and temperate forests
		 - New wind-resistant species after Katrina
	 - Make biomes patchy w/ several nearby communities
	 - Wildfires are key to savannas, chaparal, grasslands, many coniferous forests
	 - Fire fights invasive speicies
 - Biome chart in 52.2.3 if you really need it

## Aquatic Biomes are diverse and Dynamic Systems that cover most of Earth
 - Aquatic biomes are characterized by physical and chemical environment
 - Less latitudinal variation, types very distributed
 - Oceans are largest biome(75% earths surface)
 - Greatly impact biosphere
	 - Water evaporated from oeans makes rainfall
	 - Algae and bacteria supply much of oxygen, Ocean temps affect climate and winds
	 - Moderate(verb) climate
 - Freshwater is linked to soils and biotic components of nearby terrestrial biomes
 - Freahwater bionf characteristics influenced by patterns and speed of water flow and climate

### Zonation in Aquatic Biomes
 - Most are physically and chemically stratified/layered, both vertically and horizantaly
 - Light is absorbed, decreases rapidly with depth
	 - Upper photic zone is where photosynth is possible
	 - Lower aphotic zone is where not possible(both together make up pelagic zone)
	 - Deep in aphotic is abyssal zone(2-6k m down)
	 - Bottom is benthic zone(sand/organic/inorganic sediments, organisms there called benthos)
		 - Major food souce is detritus
	 - Water is warmed by sun near top, deeper is colder
	 - In ocean and most lakes, narrow layer of temp change(thermocline seperates warm upper layer from colder deep)
	 - Lakes layered wrt temp, cycle semi-seasonally(spring and autumn)(called turnover)
	 - Oxygenated water from surface to bottom, nutrient rich water to top
 - Communities distributed according to water depth, light penetration, distance from shore, in open warer or near bottom
 - Plankton and many fish live in shallow photic zone
 - Most ocean volume is dark, has little life

## Interactions between organisims and the environment limit the distribution of species
 - Distributions are the consiquence of ecology and evolutionary history
 - Kangaroos only in austrailia bc evolved AFTER austrialila broke w/ pangea
 - What factors determine their distribution

### Dispersal and DIstribution
 - Dispersion - movement of individuals or gametes away from hteir area of origin or from centers of high population density
 - Natural Range Expansions and Adaptive Radiation
	 - Dispersal is most evident when organism goes to new place
	 - Cattle egret managed to colonize in SA despite only being in Afr and SW Europe
 - Rare cases, long distance dispersal can lead to adaptive radiation
	 - Rapid evolution of an ancestral species into many new species that fill many niches
 - Use expiremental methods to determine effect of dispersal in limiting species distribution
 - Species Transplants
	 - Observing results of intentional or accidental transplants of species to new area to see if dispersal is limiting distribution
	 - if transplant is successful(lives and reproduces), then potential range of species is larger than actual range(could live where it does not currently)
	 - Ecologists prefer observing transplants rather than performin bc can have bad fx

### Biotic Factors
 - Ability of species to survive is limited by interactions w/ predators or competitive herbivores 
 - Sea urchins eat seaweed, reduce amounts, limit seaweed frowth
 - Presence or absence of pollinators, food resources, parasites, pathogens, competing organisms can limit too

### Abiotic Factors
 - If physical conditions do not allow species to reproduce, will not be found there
 - Abiotic factors vary over space and time
	 - Fluxuations  Either blur or accentuate regional distinctions
	 - Organisms can avoid flux by hibernating, dormacy, etc
 - Temperature
	 - Effects biological processes
		 - Freezing lyses cells
		 - Organisms typically function best in certian temps
	 - Proteins denature above 45C
	 - May require extra energy to live in nonoptimal region(Sweat, etc)
 - Water and Oxygen
	 - Variation in water availability is also important
	 - Seashore or wetland creatures may fry out
	 - Amphibians that use wet skin for gas exchange are vuln
	 - Desert organisims have adaptations
	 - O2 availability in aquatic environments and flooded soils is issue
		 - Mangroves and others have specializef roots go above water to get o2
 - Salinity
	 - Salt concentration affects organizm balance thru osmosis
	 - Most restricted to fresh or saltwater bc osmoregulation depends on salt
 - Sunlight
	 - Provides nrg to most ecosystems
	 - Too little light can limit species distribution
		 - Esp in forest floors
		 - In water, every meeter absorbs 45% red light, 2% blue light
	 - Too Much light too
		 - Deserts increase stress if unable to cool
		 - High elevations, sun more likely to cause mutations(Tree line on slopes)
 - Rocks and Soil
	 - pH, Mineral composition, physical strurcture of rocks and soil limits distribution
	 - Can limit directly or indirectly thru solubility of toxins and nutrients
	 - Posphorosus is insoluble for basica soils
	 - River rocks(riverbed) can affect chemistry, influence organisims that burrow into it

## Ecological Change and Evolution affect one another over long and short periods of time
 - Origin and diversification of plants
	 - Plants affected carbon cycling, remover large amounts of co2
	 - New plants provide habitats and sources of food for insects
 - Eco-Evoltionary affects occur over centuries or eons also documented
 - Can happen over short itme too
 - Rapid evolution can also cause rapid ecology change
 - Guppy populations evolve rapidly when predators re removed
	 - New guppies have different effects on algae vs invertibrate populations

# Chapter 53 Population Ecology
## 53.1 Biotic and abiotic factors affect population density, dispersion, and demographics
 - Population is group of individuals of same species living in area
	 - Rely on same resources, influenced by same environmental factors, likely to interact+breed
	 - Described by Boundaries and size

### Density and dispersion
 - Popualation density is number of indiiduals per unit area of volume
 - Dispersion is pattern of individuals spacing out in pop boundaries
 - Dynamic Density
	 - Sometimes you can count individuals in a population
		 - Sometimes have to use sampling techniques(sample 5 100x100 spots)
			 - Most accurate when there are many samples/area is homogenious
		 - Sometimes use indicator like fecal droppings
		 - Mark-recapture method to estimate wildlife population size
	 - Density changes over time w/ individuals added or removed from population
		 - Additions thru birth, immigration
		 - Removals thru death, emigration
		 - Emigration can result in est of new populaitons

### Patterns of dispersion
 - Spacing amond individuals may differ bc biotic and abiotic factors
	 - Most common is clumped; group together where food is, associated w/mating+predation/defense
	 - Uniform; maintain even spacing, happens by interaction(sometimes agressive) btw individuals(terreitoriality)
	 - Random; Position of one individual is independnt of any other, absence of strong other factors, windblown seeds, etc

### Demographics
 - Biotic and abiotic factors influencing density also influence birth, death, migration
 - Demography is the study of these characteristics, often w/ life tables
 - Life tables
	 - Researchers follow cohort(group of similarly-aged individuals) from birth to death
	 - Determine porportion of cohort who survives from one agegroup to the next+ Number of offspring produced
	 - Often ignore males and focus on females bc they do the reproduction
 - Survivorship Curves
	 - Survival rate in a life table represented as a survivorship curve(plot of porportion of cohort still alive at each age)
	 - Many different patterns of survivorship(three types of curves)
		 - I(humans); flat at start, drops steeply as you age
		 - II; constant death rate over lifespan
		 - III; Drops sharply at start, flattens out bc animals surviving birth survivie for a while
	 - Many fall intermediate
		 - Birds have high death rate for young(III), but constant death after that(II)
		 - Crabs have stair-stepping bc most die during mold periods
 - In populations with low im/emigration, survivorship+reproduction rates determine changes in pop size

### Reproducitve Rates
 - Reproduciton viewed as females giving rise to new females
 - Count via count method or mark-recapture method
 - By looking at genetic material of eggs of turtles and possible parents, researchers able to determine which parents gave offspring w/o affecting reproduciton
 - Measured as avg number of female offspring produced by the females in a given group
 - Reproduction lvls diff by age, are diff btw species

## CONCEPT 53.2 The exponential model describes population growth in an idealized, unlimited environment
### Changes in population size
 - In ideal conditions, $Change\ in\ population\ size = Births\ +\ Immigrants\ entering\ population\ -\ Deaths\ -\ Emigrants\ Leaving\ Population$
 - Simplify by ignoring immigration and emigration
	 - $\Delta n$ is change in population size
	 - $\frac{\Delta n}{\Delta t} = B-D$
	 - R is change in population size, $B-D = R = \frac{\Delta n}{\Delta t}$
 - Per capita population size($r_{\Delta t}$) is average contribution of an individual to the number of individuals added to ar subtracted from the populaiton in that time interval
	 - $R = r_{\Delta t}*N$
	 - $\frac{\Delta n}{\Delta t} = r_{\Delta t}*N$
	 - $\frac{dn}{dt} = rN$

## Exponential growth
 - Occurs without any limiting factors other than physiological capacity
	 - Equation is $\frac{dn}{dt} = rN$
	 - r is the intrinsic rate of increase
 - Happens in nature when introduced to new environment or numbers drastically reduced by event

## CONCEPT 53.3 The logistic model describes how a population grows more slowly as it nears its carrying capacity
 - In most scenarios, as pop size increases, each individual has fewer resources
 - Carrying capacity is limit, where each individual has just enough resources to survive
	 - (maximum populaiton size a particular environment can sustain)

### The Logistic Growth Model
 - Per capita pop growth rate decreases as n increases in logistic model
 - $\frac{dn}{dt} = rN * \frac{K-N}{K}$
 - Exponential growth times Fraction of carrying capacity($K$) for populaiton growth


# Chapter 54 Community Ecology
 - Foundation species(large species that provide habitat and food for other organismims(coral reef))
 - Interactions between species(competition(negative both)/Exploitation(negative one)/Positive interactions(benefit one or both while not harming the other))
 - Other factors affecting community structure(Num of species, particular species present, relative abundance of species)

## Concept 54: Interactions between species can help, harm, or have no effect on the individuals involved
 - Some relationships in the life of an organism are reationships with others within community
	 - Interspecific interactions
	 - Competition, predation, herbivory, parasitism, mutualism, commensalism
	 - Can have + or - or 0 interaction on both involved
		 - Predation is +/- bc has positive effect on one, negative on the other
		 - Mutualism is +/+
	 - Broader catagories
		 - Competition(-/-)
		 - Exploitation(+/-)
		 - Positive interactions(+/+ or +/0)

### Competition
 - -/-, harms both individuals
 - Both individuals use a resource that limits the survival and reproduciton of bot indiviudals
	 - Can also occur within a species(intraspecific competition)
	 - Weeds for nutrients/lynx+foxes for prey
	 - Oxygen is a resource, but is plentiful, so rearely competed for
 - Competitive Exclusion
	 - When 2 species compete for limited resources, they cannot coexist bc one has an edge for obtaining food
	 - Even slight reproductive advantage wins
	 - This outcome is called competitive exclusion
 - Ecological niches and Natural selection
	 - Competition can cause evolution
	 - Niche is the biotic and abiotic factors in an organism's life
	 - Two species cannot coexist permanently in a community if their niches are identical
	 - Similar species can coexist if differences in niches exist
	 - Thus two similar species niches can change as opposed to evolving to win entirely
	 - Called resource partitioning
	 - A species fundamental niche(potentially occupied niche) is different from realized niche(portion of fundamental actually occupied)
	 - Niches can be partitioned in time(same resources at diff times)
 - Character Displacement
	 - Closely related species who are sometimes near and soemtimes far away from eachother also show how competition affect communities
	 - Physically close species are more different than physically distant species
	 - Process of attributes displacing when closer is character displacememnt

### Expolitation
 - Any +/- interaction where ne species benefit by feeding on/harming another species(predation, herbivory, parasitism)
 - Predation
	 - +/- interaction 
	 - Individual of one species kills and eats individual of another species
	 - Eating and avoiding being eaten are key to reporduction, adaptations of both are refined thru naturall selection
		 - Some snakes find prey with heat-sensing organs
		 - Owls have large eyes to avoid prey
		 - Claws, fangs, poison
		 - Behavior adaptations like hiding, fleeing, herds/schools
		 - Porcupines+skunks
		 - Aposematic coloration(brightly colored prey often avoided)
		 - Cryptic coloration(camoflague)
		 - Batesian mimicry(mimic predator/poisionous)
		 - Mullerian mimicry(2 predators/poisinous mimic eachother)
		 - Mimicry in predators(octupus that mimics)
 - Herbivory
	 - Herbivore eats parts of plant or algae harming but not killing it 
	 - Many herbivores
	 - Specialized aptations
		 - Insects w/ foot sensors to tell plant toxicity or nutiritional value
		 - Use smell for same thing ^
		 - Specialized teeth or digestion
		 - Plant can defend with toxins or spines and thorns
 - Parasitism
	 - Parasite gets nourishment from host, which is harmed
	 - Parasites inside host are endoparasites, outside are ectoparasites
	 - Eggs layed inside other organism
	 - Many parasites' life cycles involve many hosts
	 - Many alter host behavior to increase odds of meeting new host

### Positive Interactions(+/+ or +/0)
 - Mutualism benefits both species
	 - Common in nature
	 - Cellulose digestion
	 - Seed pollinators/distributors
	 - Also costs
		 - Transfers materials it could have used to support its own metabolism
		 - For it to be a mutualism, benefits must exceed costs
		 - When ^ is not the case, may break down
 - Commensalism(+/0)
	 - Also common in nature
	 - Low-light wildflowers rely on shade trees to prevent competition
	 - Cattle egrets feed on insects that bison disturb whilst roaming(sometimes some benefit for the cattle by removing skin mites, etc)
	 - +/0 can become +/+
	 - plants that make things that alter conditions(marsh salinity ex) to support other plants

## Chapter 55: Ecosystems and restoration Ecology
 - Movement of energy(plants, sun, others)

### 55.1 Physical Laws govern energy flow and chemical cycling in ecosystems
 - Ecosystem is the sum of all the organisims living in a given area and the abiotic factors
 - Energy Flow and Chemical Cycling
	 - All ecosystems have Energy Flow and Chemical cycling
	 - Energy enters as sunlight, converted to chemical by autotrophs, passed to hetrotrophs + make heat
	 - Chemicals are cycled thru biotic and abiotic ecosystem components
		 - Taken up in organiv form from air, soil, water, incorporated into organic compounds, returned eventually as waste
	 - Energy has a one-way flow(in->out), Chemicals cycle
 - Conservation of Energy
	 - Ecologists map how feeding relationships and organism interactions move energy
	 - First law of thermodynamics(energy conservation) applied to sun, photosynthesis, chemicals in plants
		 - Use to understand habitat organism capacity and amount of food humans can harvest from a site
	 - 2nd law(inc entropy) applied to ecosystems, nrg flows thru, dosent cycle
 - Conservation of Mass
	 - Mass is conserved, so amnt of chemical element cycles within ecosystem or is gained or lost can be determined
	 - Chmical elements ARE continiously cycled(unlike nrg)
	 - CAN be gained or lost
		 - Forest gains nutrients from dust in wind or rainfall or rock erosion
		 - Nitorgen supplied thru N fixation
		 - Lose to gases, water/wind
	 - Most gains and losses are small compared to cycling amnt
 - Energy, Mass, and Trophic Levels
	 - Species in ecosystem grouped based on feeding relationships
		 - Primary prodcers support everything else(autotrophs, photosynthetic, chemosynthetic in some places like hydrothermal vents)
		 - Heterotrophs(consumers)
		 - Primary consumers = herbivores
		 - Secondary consumers eat herbivores
		 - Tertiary consumers eat carnivores
		 - Decomposers get nrg from detritus
			 - Enzymes to digest organic material+absorb nutrients
			 - Then consumed by other heterotrophs
			 - Also play key role in ecosystem trophic relationships, convert matter from all levels to be used by primary producers

### 55.2 Energy and other limiting factors control primary production in ecosystems
 - Light energy converted to chemical is primary production(in systems with chemoautotrophs, inital input is chemical and initial products are what is synthed)
 - Ecosystem Energy BUdgets
	 - Each day, earths atmosphere gets enough nrg to sustain the 2013 human population for 19 yrs
	 - Intensity vaires by latitude, tropics get most
	 - ~50% is absorbed, scattered, reflected(half makes it to earth)
	 - Much radiation strikes in nonphotosynthetic places(ice and soil)
	 - Only certian wavelengths
	 - ~1% visible light striking photosynthetic of organisms converted to chem nrg
 - Gross and Net Production
	 - kish did this(GPP = Gross Primary Production, R_t = taxes/respiration)
	 - NEP = Net Ecosystem producction is measure of biomass accumulation by producers AND consumers(GPP-R_t), measured by flux of CO2 entering and exiting ecosystem
 - Upwelling - natural aquatic recycling of nutrients to photic zne
 - Temperature+Moisture are main factors fcontrolling primary production in terrestrial ecosystems
 - Addition of Species to ecosystems can alter cycle, changing nutrient availability
 - Nitrogen limits plant growth most
 - Adding a nonlimiting nutrient does nothing
 - Evolutionnnn
	 - Mutualism btw plant roots and nitrogen-fixing bacteria
	 - Mycorrhizal association btw roots+phosphorus fngi
	 - Root hairs increase surface area
 - Climate change fx
	 - 1982-99, NPP increased 6% in terrestrial ecosystems(mostly tropical forests)
	 - NEP>0, carbon sink(gains more carbon than looses); NEP<0, loses more than gains(Source)
	 - Global warming make some arctic ecosystems carbon sources by inc metabolic soil bact. activities

### 55.3 10% rule
 - Production Efficency
	 - Primary consumers use ~1/6 potential energy in a leaf for growth
	 - Production efficency is % energy stored in assimilated food used for growth+Reproduction(NOT respiration)
	 - Birds and mamalls are ~1-3% efficency
	 - FIshes ~10%, Insects+microrganisms ~40%
 - Trophic efficiency
	 - Percent production from one TL to next
	 - Lower than production efficency bc also take into account food that isnt consumed/is wasted
	 - Average ~10%
	 - Limits aboundance of top lvl carnivores in an ecosystem
	 - Can have inverted trophic pyrimad if small biomass of primary producers produces fast enough, cycles thru enough generations, and is eaten fast enough

### Concept 55.4 Biological and geochemical processes cycle nutrients and water in ecosystems
 - Elements must be recycled(waste products, decomposers, etc)
 - Decomposer growth controlled by temp, moisture, nutrient availability
	 - Grow faster, metabolize faster in warmer ecosystems
	 - In faster-growing scenarios, nutrient availability may be limited at one time bc cycles fast
	 - Decomposers are bad at growing in cold and wet(peatlands)
		 - In these places, NPP > Decomposition rate, so they store lotsa organic matter
	 - Aquatic decomposition in muds+Stuff takes forever, plants get nutrients directly from water, only refresh with upwelling
 - Biogeochemical cycles
	 - 2 types: Global and Local
	 - Gases in the atmosphere(carbon, oxygenn, sulfur, nitrogen), global cycle
	 - Others are too heavy(Phosphorous, potassium, calcium, transported as dust+plant roots+decomposers, etc), cycle more in aquatic ecosystems

### Concept 55.5 Restoration ecologists return degraded ecosystems to a more natural state
 - Ecosystems commonly recover naturally from many disturbances w/ ecological succession
 - Hard to recover from human mining
 - May need to alter the topographyto restore rivers, etc
 - Boremediation
	 - Uses organisms(prokaryotes, fungi, plants) to detodxify polluted ecosystems
	 - Bacteria that concentrates nuclear water into black pigment
 - Biological Augmentation
	 - Organisms add essential materials to degraded ecosystem
	 - First determine what is missing
	 - Sometimes help wildlife(Animals) to reach+use restored ecosystem to circulate seeds, etc
	 -
