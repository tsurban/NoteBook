CHAPTER 8+9-READ
Enzymes - lower activation energy
Reaction Types:
 - Condensation or hydrolyitic
 - Dehyudration or hydrolysis
 - Seems simple, not really
Metabolisim
 - Anabolic Metabolisim
	 - Constructive/builds stuff up
	 - Naturally exist in body(estrogen, toteseterone, progesterone)
 - Catabolic metabolisim
	 - Breakdown/Destrucive
	 - If you take in a lot, body uses as fuel, stores what is left over
	 - In adolescence, metabolisim switches
	 - Fetal metabolisim(in utero)-->Toddler metabolisim(birth thru puberty)-->Adult(slow metabolisim(forever))
 - Basic equation(both)
     - $C_6 H_12_0_6 + 6O_2 <-> 6H_2O+6CO_2 + 36 ATP$
	 - Perfectly balanced except for energy
	 - Preferred carbohydrate is glucose(only thing that can be used by )
	 - These are idealized numbers(every mole potentially can make 36 atp)
	 - 36 atp is not actually created(heat as byproduct)
 - Everybody has a basal metabolisim
 - Cycles
	 - ATP Cycle
		 - ATPase/ATPsynthase
	 - NAD Cycle(electron recycler)
	    - Oxidation reaction
- Enzyme tech tips
	- Almost all end in -ASE
	- Usually have practical names
 - **ALL CHEMICAL REACTIONS IN BODY DRIVEN BY ENZYMES**
	 - DNA codes for enzymes
	 - Most proteins produced are enzymes
 - ATP
	 - Adenine+Ribose+Phosphates
	 - High nrg bonds btw phosphates
 - Thermodynamics
	 - 1st law: Nrg neither created or destroyed
	 - 2nd law: Entropy
 - Enzymes
	 - Made up of
		 - Protein-Apoenzyme(tertiary shape(Seccondary but folded on itself)
		 - Non-protein organic-Coenzyme
			 - Coenzymes can also be vitamins
		 - Cofactors are nonorganic trace metals
		 - Together=Holoenzyne(DIFF FROM ENZYME HOW???????)
			 - Holoenzyme only used as word in txtbook
	 - Active site:where physical, chemical reaction takes place
		 - Coenzyme in active site either donates water(hydrolytic), or removes water(dehydrative)
		 - May also have proton or $e^-$ donations
		 - Some enzymes called Allosteric(refer to notebook)
			 - Modulator site
			 - Multiple sites where cofactors plug in
			 - Cofactors are metals($Mg^2, Mn^2, Co, As$)
			 - Depending on the reaction, you may need different cofactors
			 - ALLOSTERIC Enzymes can make multiple(similar) things
			 - The metals provide $e^-$ for chem. reactions
	 - Catalayse gets rid of $H_2 O_2$
	 - Breaks down 40 million h2o2 per 1s
	 - HOW?
		 - Active site(substrate fits into it)
		 - Tugs on, breaks down substrate
		 - Important to turn on and off enzymes
		 - Activation by cofactors and coenzymes
		 - Inhibition -- Competitive(blocked) or ???
		 - Fits like a key fits a lock
		 - lowers activation nrg, tugs by changing ph or mechanical tug
		 - Just speeds up a reaction, h2o2 would slowly break down
		 - It is able to be so fast because h2o2 is slightly unstable, dont need to lower Act Nrg a lot
		 - Would produce protein until required(can wait to produce substrate or can activate at specific time)
		 - Need to add cofactors(inorganic) and coenzymes(organic) before the enzyme can work
		 - Inhibioion
			 - Competitive inhibition(Bonding at active site, competitor competes for the active site witht the eubstrate)
			 - Allosteric(bonds to another place on the enzyme, blocks active site or changes shape of active site)
		 - Eventually rate of reaction will level off after limits of various things reached
		 - 1st model is lock and key theory
			 - each enzyme has one specific substrate that fits into it
			 - like a lock(enzyme) and key(substrate)
			 - EX:sucrase only fits sucrose
			 - we would need way more enzymes
		 - 2nd model
			 - induced fit thory
			 - gives idea about allosteric enzymes
			 - different cofactors alter the shape of the enzyme, allow for different(but similar) substrates
		 - Both models in play
	 - Enzyme picture
		 - free gibbs energy on y, progression of reaction on x
		 - with enzyme, amount of energy much lower
	 - Interference of enzymes
		 - Denature them(actually break hydrogen bonds)/(return to primary state)
			 - pH -- all body systems have specific pH for function "optimum pH" 7.10 for humans -- breaks down by offering oxygens an easier place to bond(with h+ or OH-), breaks hydrogen bonds, respridory acidosis shows in type 1 diabetics
			 - Temp -- same thing but only works for hot temperatures -- think albumin in an egg shell turns from clear to white bc denatured--dosent happen for cold temps.  
			 - Active site==Catalytic site
		 - Inhibitors
			 - Competitive inhibition -- something with similar shape sits in active site, enzyme dosent do anything, eventually, inhu=ibitor disengages, enzyme functions again(regulatory protein)
			 - Noncompetitive inhibiition -- alloseric enzyme has wrong modulator/cofactor/allosteric site, reaction cannot occur -- usually permenant
	 - NO SLIDE ON THIS
		 - Reaction rates(all of above affect reaction rates)
		 - Putting living organisims in nonoptimal temp WILL affect the functioning of the enzymes
		 - fridge or freezer slows reactions extremley
 - PHOSPHORYLATION
	 - adding a phosphate group to something(many applicaitions)
	 - picture
	 - substrative/simple phosphoralyation
		 - atp, adp, amp
		 - stick phosphate group onto other compound 
	 - first step of glycolosis
	 - oxidative phosphorlyation
		 - have oxygen in there somehwere
	 - Photo-Oxidative phosphorlyation
		 - only light energy
		 - photosynthesis
 - All living organisims use cell resp. to make atp, support selves
	 - Glycolosis, Krebs cycle, ETC
	 - EVERY SINGLE LIVING ORGANISIM GOES THROUGH GLYCOLYSIS AT LEAST(krebs, etc are optional)
		 - Glycolosis starts and ends in cytoplasm
		 - not in mitochandria
		 - First of metabolic pathways that evolved
		 - Splitting carbohydrate
		 - Most commonly glucose, we talk about glucose, but there are others used
	 - Krebs cycle and ETC happen in mitochandria
		 - When mitochandria evolved through endosymbiosis, thats when krebs and etc became important
	 - These three steps are the only ones that produce atp
	 - Glycolysis(picture)
		 1. Molecule of glucose
		 2. Substrate level phosphorolation(gluose has phosphate group added by atp)
			 - hydroxil group displaced
			 - some glucose bonds energized
			 - named glucose 6 phosphate bc phosphate is on 6th oxy and adp 
		 3.Rearrangement
			 - gluecose 6 phosphate goes to fructose 6 phosphate(carboxyl moves)
		 4. Another rearrangement, becomes fructose 1, 6 phosphate(gains phosphate from another atp)
			 - Fructose 1, 6 phosphate is unstable
		 5. Fructose 1,6 phosphate splits into two things
			 1. On Left: Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate(G-3-P)(main compound)
			 2. On Right:Dihydroxyacetonephosphate(DHAP)
			 - basically interchangable/cell can convert one btw one and the other
			 - DHAP for fatty acids
			 - G3P for respiration(assume everything becomes G3P)
			 - Everything up until now is **investment phase**
	 - Used 2 atp, made 2 molecules G3P
		 6. Energy **Payoff phase**
			 - NADox is NAD+ NADre +2H+
			 - NAD hooks up with inorganic phosphorous, makes glyceraldehyde 1,3 phosphate
			 - the third phosphate is high energy bond
			 - displaced hydrogen picked up by NAD, lotsa potential nrg
		 7. Then 2 ATP Created by NAD
		 8. the glyceraldehyde goes through a number of transformations 
		 9. 2H20 breaks off, creates high energy phosphorous bond
		 10. 2 more ATP formed
		  - end result is 2 molecules of pyruvic acid, 2 atp, 2 electron carriers(nad)(glycolosis stops there)
- Pyruvic acid
  - Fermentation
	  - MUST HAVE GLYCOLYSIS(All organisims use glycolysis)
	  - Takes place in cytoplasm
	  - NADH2 is toxic, need to get rid of H2
	  - Lactic Acid Fermentation(Muscle Cells and bacteria)
		  - Happens once all oxygen in cells is gone
		  - Muscles still have to produce nrg, no oxy, produce lactic acid
		  - Lactic acid gradually removed from cells, sent to liver
		  - Pyruvic acid is final electron acceptor, becomes lactic acid(compound that is reduced to take the H2 from NADH2)
		  - This is how you get yogurt, sour cream, etc
		  - (skim milk+bacteria)/24 hours, you have ^
	  - Achoholic Fermentation(yeast)
		  - yeast only need oxy for cell wall
		  - only eukaryotic organisim that dosent use krebs or ETC(have mitochandria, dont use)
		  - Take carboxyl group off of pyruvic acid, co2 produced(beer can explode)
		  - "Decarboxylation" - end with 2 carbon structure(end with Acetyl)
		  - Acetyl is final e- acceptor, becomes reduced into enthanol
  - Transportation of pyruvic acid to mitochandria
	  - Motor molecule atches to substrate, moves along cytoskeleton(lose 2ATP)
  - In mitochandria
	  - Transitioned to Acetyl-Coenzyme A
		  - Lose CO2 in decarboxylation(exhaled)
		  - Decarboxylated Pyruvic acid  is acetate
		  - To get acetate to mitochandrial matrix, hooked to Coenxyme A
		  - Make NADH2 to attach acetate to coenzyme A
		  - Total produced 4 NADH2
	  - Acetylcoa travels to MCM, does krebs cycle
	  - Krebs Cycle/Citric acid cycle
		  - For every glucose molecule, krebs cycle turns twice
		  - In mitochandria, COA releases Acetyl
		  - Acetyl(2 carbon) hooks up with 4 carbon to make 6 carbon group, losing co2
		  - NAD reduced, lose some e-(2NAD produced)
		  - turns twice, get 2 ATP, 8 NADH2
	  - Now we have a total of 12 NADH2
	  - ETC
		  - Essentially nothing left of og glucose except for NADH2
		  - ETC is series of protiens in membrane and every protein is a proton pump
		  - Physically moves protons from area of low concentration from area of low concentration to high concentration(active)
		  - Series of oxydation reduction reactions(e- exchanged)
		  - A little bit of energy is produced by ^
		  - Lowering energy present by oxydizing
		  - ALL NAD goes here(glycolysis, transition, NAD+FAD from krebs) - 12 in all
		  - Series of oxidizing/reducing reactions
		  - As you reduce the carriers, you are losing nrg(downhill)
		  - Proteins in membrane(almost identical to proteins in bacteria, in chloroplast==>evidence for endosymbiosis)
		  - Proteins are proton pumps, pump proteins from low concentration to high concentration(inside membrane to outside)
		  - e- go to different proteins, end with molecule of oxy, forming H2O(only point where see oxygen--can be replaced with sulfur or carbon eg)
	  - All plays into ATP synthase
		  - Hydrogen ions = protons
		  - Gradient exists between two sides of membrane
		  - Potential energy found in gradients
		  - Significantly more protons on one side
		  - ATP synthase rotates when a proton enters
		  - Once 3 protons, ATP formed
		  - No more gradient
		  - ATP transported by diffusion or stays in Mitochandria
		  - Produces 32 more atp for the entire 12 NADH
		  - Humans not totally effective at this, more like mid 20s
	  - Prokaryote ETC
		  - Plasma membrane houses process virtually identival process
		  - many prokaryotes don't go thru this process(only ferment)
		  - Far more efficent to use ETC(36 ATP vs 2 ATP)
	  - Alternatives to glycolysis(in prokaryotes)(create pyruvate from glucose)(NEED TO KNOW MORE THAN IS HERE)
		  - 
		  - Phosphoglucanate pathway
		  - Pentose Pathway
		  - Entmer-Dourdorff Pathway(mostly e.coli)
	  - Alternatives to glucose
		  - Fatty acids, Nucleic Acids, Amino Acids
		  - Nuleic acids and amino acids not prefferred bc nitrogen poisionus to cell
	  - Fatty acids
		  - In humans, Fatty acids stored in atapose cells(yellow fat)
		  - In humans, Once fat in cell, hard to pull out
		  - In others, Brown fat(lotsa blood vessels), use for hybernation
		  - Fat broken down w/ beta oxidation
		  - Fat cells long
		  - In any animal, majority fats saturated
		  - Fatty acid cut into 2-carbon(acetyl groups), get maximum atp
		  - 3x ATP produced for fatty acid(not great bc must use atp to produce too)
- MR ANDERSON CELL RESP
- BREAKS DOWN FOOD AND MAKES NRG
	- Aerobic respiration is sustainable, anerobic respiration is like nitro; boost, but not for long
- Resperation for heterorphs
	- breaks down organic compounds into co2, water, atp
	- Autotrophs convert co2 and water back into organic compounds, also use orgnaic compounds to get nrg
	- opposite of photosynthesis(glucose+oxy -> co2 and water and atp)
	- energy is in the hydrogens in glucose
	- energy comes from the bonding of hydrogens to oxygen
- Mitochandria
	- folds called cristae
	- two membranes(inner membrane and outer membrane)
	- intermembrane space
	- mitochandria have own dna, do binary fission
- Three steps to cell resp
	- Glycolosis
		- happens outside mitochandria
		- glucose broken into pyruvate(3 carbons) makes 2atp
		- converted into Acetyl COA by Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex(loses CO2, 1/3 of lost CO2)
		- pyruvate goes into krebs cycle, converted into 2 carbons acetyl CoA, into krebs cycle, gives off 2 more co2(2/3 CO2)
		- produces a little bit atp, give more energy to NADH and FADH2, electrons go thru ETC Makes NADH
		- ETC
			- electrons move through series of proteins
			- pumps hydrogen ion protons out of membrane into inner membrane space
			- electrons and hydrogen ions used to create water and atp
			- NADH AND FADH pumped thru, creates protons(H+), Inter-membrane space becomes full, positively charged
			- ATP Synthase combines H+ proton, switches it and attaches phosphate to make atp
			- Fadh drops 2 electrons thru Nadh does 3
		- What if no O2 or no MitoChandria
		- Electrons added to NAD+, no more NAD+, whole process stops
		- Lactic acid fermentation
			- Cells ferment pyruvate into lactate, accepts NADH electrons, and have NAD+
			- Lactate takes oxygen to break down
			- Alchoic fermentation does the same thing, but makes ethyl alchohol and co2(ONLY IN YEAST)
	- What happens to lactate
		- Muscle did anerobic fermentation, end up with lactic acid
		- lactic acid moved to blood, to liver
		- Lactic acid+NAD+O2-->Pyruvic acid+NADH+O2
		- Pyruvic acid goes to mitochandria, transition, krebs, ETC
	- Acedemic opporutnity will cover Enzymes and Cell resp, not Fridays photosynth
