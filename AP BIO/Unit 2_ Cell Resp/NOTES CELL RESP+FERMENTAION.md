## How is ATP made 
## 9.1, Catabolic pathways yield energy by oxidizing organic fuels
### Catabolic Pathways and Production of ATP
 - Cells seek to degrade high-energy molecules into lower energy molecules; some 'lost' nrg used for work, some lost(heat)
 - Fermentation is partial degredation of fuel without oxy
 - Aerobic respiration is much more efficent
 - Cellular respiration usually means aerobic
	 - overall, $Organic \space Compounds + Oxygen \to CO_2+H_2O+Energy$
	 - Typical reaction is with monosaccharide glucose, $C_6H_{12}O_6+6O_2 \to 6CO_2+6H_2O+Energy(ATP+Heat)$
	 - glucose bdown Exergonic, -686kcal(spontaneous)

### Redox Reactions
 - How energy yielded = transfer of e-
 - e- transfered in redox reactions
	 - loss of e- called oxidation
	 - add e-  called reduction
	 - varying degrees of transfer possible
	 - In covalent bonds, bonds can be rearranged to be shared less equally
		 - Methane+Oxygen->CO2+H20
		 - Carbon and Hydrogen oxidized bc Oxygen pulls on e- more
		 - overall loss of nrg bc e- held more tightly(lower potential)
 - In Cell Resp
	 - C6H12O6 becomes oxidized into CO2
	 - O2 becomes reduced into H2O
	 - In general, organic molecules with much H2 have lotsa nrg bc many hilltop e-
	 - CH bonds become CO(in general)
	 - Carbs and fats have many hilltop e- bc H
 - How cells harness nrg
	 - Nrg must be carefully used efficently
	 - e- carriers needed to use small steps
	 - NAD good bc switches easily bc NADH and NAD+
	 - But, like, practically, how
		 - Dehydrogenases remove H pair from glucose, oxidize it
		 - NAD Nicotinamide group accepts two e-, one H+, becomes NADH
	 - attraction btw H2 and O2 harnessed in small bits in ETC
	 - ETC is series of proteins built into mitochandria inner membranse
	 - e- from NADH go to top of chain, at bottom O2 captures e-&H+, forming water
	 - Each step in ETC has greater pull on e-, can oxidize previous step

### Preview of Cell Resp stages
 - Glycolysis, Pyruvate Oxidation, Citric Acid CYcle, Oxidative Phosphorlyation(ETC+chemiosmosis)
 - Glycolysis+Pyruvate Oxidation and Citric acid cycle break down glucose
 - Glycolyis, in cytosol, breaks glu into pyruv
 - then pyruv enters mitochondrion, made into acetyl CoA
 - then citric acid cycle breaks pyruv into CO2 and NAD+ becomes NADH
 - ETC takes NADH or FADH2 e-, passes e- down chain, combined with O2 to make water
 - Chemiosmosis+ETC make up oxidative phosphorylation(90% total generation here)

### 9.2 Glycolysis(glucose->pyruvate)
 - Glycolysis means sugar splitting
 - Glucose(6C) split into pyruvate(3C)
 - 2 phases(energy investment phase and payoff phase)
 - Net energy yield is 2ATP, 2NADH
 - No CO2 Released

### 9.3 Citric Acid Cycle
 - Most of nrg still in pyruvate
 - When Oxygen is present, pyruvate goes into mitochandria
 - Oxidation of glucose completed in cytosol in mitochandria
 - Oxidation of Pyruvate to Acetyl CoA
	 - First converted to Acetyl CoA
	 - Links glycolysis and Citric Acid Cycle
	 - Three steps
		 - Pyruvate Carboxyl group(already low nrg) is fully oxidized(goes to no nrg), CO2 released
		 - remaining fragment oxidized, e- transferred to NAD+
		 - CoA attached to fragment after e- gone(acetyl), makes acetyl CoA
		 - Acetyl CoA has high PE, used in in Citric Acid cycle

 - Citric Acid Cycle
	 - Further oxidises pyruvate
	 - Pyruvate becomes 3 CO2(includes molecule from conv to acetyl CoA)
	 - NADH and FADH2 go to ETC
	 - 8 steps = 1 turn
	 - In each turn, molecule w/ 2 carbons enters, oxidized
	 - molecule w/2 carbons enters, joins with Oxaloaxetate from last turn(step 1,2)
	 - isocitrate formed by removing h20, drops 2 CO2 and makes 2 NADH(3,4)
	 - GTP which acts like and can become ATP formed somehow(5)
	 - Remaining molecule converted back to oxaloaxetate, creating 1 fadh2 and 1 nadh and taking in an H20
 - for each acetyl group, 3 NADH formed and 1 FADH2 formed
 - total for 1 glucose is 6 NADH, 2 FADH2

 ### 9.4 Oxidative Phosphorylation
  -  Before this step, 2 ATP from gly, 2 from Krebs, 12 NADH+FADH2
  - Pathway of e- transport
	  - ETC is collection of proteins in inner membrane of mitochandrion or plasma membrane(bacteria)
	  - Cristae folds increase surface area
	  - chain of proteins each wanting e- more than the last, able to oxidize above, concentrate e-
	  - Various proteins accept e-, spit them out
	  - FADH2 donates e- at a lower energy position than NADH
  - Chemiosmosis(atp synthase)
	  - works backwards of ion pump
	  - uses gradient to fuel mechanical change(ATP synth)
	  - ATP synthase has 4 parts
	  - protons go onto binding site on rotor, spin it, catalyzing ADP+P
	  - Smallest molecular rotary motor in nature
	  - Gradient est. by ETC, uses e- from NADH+FADH2 to move H+
  -  An Accounting o ATP Production
	  - Glucose>NADH>ETC>chemiosmosis>ATP
	  - Nets about 20/32 ATP
	  - Why inexact
		  - ratio btw NADH and phosphorlyations varies
		  - 1 NADH ~ 2.5 ATP
		  - FADH2 enters lower, diff vals
		  - Depends on transport from cytosol to MC
		  - Not all proton-motive(ATP synthase) force used to synth atp
		  - about 34% of total nrg in glucose becomes ATP
		  - Good cars do 25%
		  - sometimes want to reduce efficency, increase heat(brown fat)

### 9.5 Fermentation
 - ETC cant be used w/o oxygen
 - Some organisims use alternative e- acceptors(sulfate), H2S is byproduct
 - Glycolysis can occur sans o2
	 - NADH needs to be recycled into NAD+ so gly can cont
	 - Aerobic, used in ETC
	 - Anerobic, e- go to pyruvate
 - Types of Fermentation 
	 - 2 types(lactic acid ferm+alch ferm)
	 - Alchohol Fermentation
		 - 2 steps
			 - 1. release CO2 from pyruvate, converted to Acetaldehyde
			 - 2. Acetaldehyde reduced to ethanol by NADH->NAD+
		 - Happens in many bacteria sans oxygen + in Yeast
	 - Lactic Acid
		 - Pyruvate directly reduced by NADH, forming Lactate
		 - In Humans
			 - Red muscle oxidizes glucose to CO2
			 - White muscle produces lactate even w/ O2
			 - Fermentation term not used bc there IS oxy
 - Fermentation vs Anaerobic+Aerobic Resp
	 - Main diff btw 3 is how NADH changed back to NAD+
		 - Fermentation, e- accepted by pyruvate(lacacid) or acetaldehyde(alchol)
		 - Cell resp, e- go to ETC
	 - Also diff how much ATP prod
		 - Ferm = 2ATP(pyruvate nrg unavalible)
		 - Cell resp, pyruvate 100% used, Aerobic = O2 is final e- acceptor Anerobic = other molec, up to 32 atp
	 - Obligate anaerobes only do ferment or anaerobic resp
		 - even if oxygen present
		 - some still cant survive w/o2
	 - Some others have no mech for anerobic resp, need o2
	 - Faculative Anerobes
		 - can do aerobic resp, dont need to(yeast)
		 - If o2 gone, no issue(less efficent, more sugar consumed)
 - Evolutionary Significance of Glycolysis
	 - Glycolysis used long before o2 in atmosphere
	 - Cyanobacteria eventually started producing o2
	 - Glycolysis so common bc evolved so early

### 9.6 Glycolysis and Citric Acid Cycle connections
 - The Versatility of Catabolism
 - Straight-up glucose not common
 - All disaccharides, starches, etc can be used by cell resp
 - Glycolysis can accept many things
	 - Starch+Glycogen is hydrolyzed to glucose
	- Proteins also can be used
		- first must be broken into amino acids, then used to build diff proteins
		- before can enter glycolysis or citric acid cycle, amino gps can be removed(deamination)
		- Nitrogenous waste becomes NH3/ammonia/urea
	- Fats
		- Digested to glycerol or fatty acids
		- Glycerol converted to G3P for glycolysis
		- Beta oxidation breaks fatty acids into 2C parts, used as Acetyl CoA
		- Fats have enough bonds to be good fuels
		- 1 gram of fat 2x nrg of 1 gram carb
		- so many cals is why it is hard to burn fat
- Biosynthesis(Anabolisim)
	- Food also provides skeleton for other cell molecules
	- Amino acids from food incorperated into body proteins
	- Intermediates of glyc+Cit Acid Cyc 
	- Humans, 1/2 amino acids from modifying Krebs intermediaries
	- the rest must come from diet
	- Biosynthesis consumes ATP
	- We convert xtra gluc into fat using dihydroxyacetone(glyc intermediary)
- Regulation of Cell Resp via Feedback loops
	- Cell stops cell resp if has enough nrg
	- Same for catabolisim(cell resp speeds up if ATP conc drops)
	- phosphofructokinae inhibits glycolysis, stops whole cycle
		- ^^ allosteric enzyme, accepts specific inhibitors and activators
		- inhibited by ATP
		- Inhibited by citrate(if somehow escapes mitochandria)
		- if citrate
