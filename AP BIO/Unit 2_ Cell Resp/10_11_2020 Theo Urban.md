## Book Notes -- Metabolisim
***
### Thermodynamics and Biology?
 - Energy can be transformed and transferred, not created or destroyed
 - Energy transfer or transformation increases entropy
##8.1 An organismâ€™s metabolism transforms matter and energy
### Metabolic Pathways
 - roadmap of chemical reactions, each with an enzyme
 - Manages the energy of the body
	 - Catabolic pathways = breakdown(cell resp)
	 - Anabolic pathways = building(amino acid synth)

### Forms of Energy
 - Energy is capacity to rearrange matter
 - Life work depends on cells changing forms of nrg
 - Kinetic nrg = Nrg assoc. with relative motion
	 - Thermal Nrg = Nrg assoc. with random mvmnt atoms
		 - When transfered from one object to another, is heat
	 - Light Nrg = photosynthesis lol
 - Non-Kinetic = Potential nrg
	 - Exists bc of location or structure
	 - Water behind dam
	 - Chemical nrg = nrg avalible for release in chem, reaction
		 - Glucose high in nrg
		 - Gas reacts w/ oxygen
 - Energy transformations
	 - all goes back to chemical food
	 - all food goes back to plants

### Laws of nrg transformation
 - Thermodynamics = nrg transformations in system
 - Surroundings = everything outside system
 - Isolated system = unable to lose or gain nrg
 - Open system = nrg can be xcgd with surroundings
	 - Organisims are open systems
 - 2 laws govern all energy transformations
	 - First law of tdymcs
		 - Energy of universe constant; 
		 - Cant be created or destroyed, can be transferred, transformed
	 - 2nd law of tdymcs
		 - Always some loss of energy in transfe/transfo to heat
		 - Most cases, most energy lost to heat
		 - Heat only useful to correct temp. diff
		 - each nrg transfer makes universe more disordered
		 - entropy = measure of molec. disorder
		 - Every nrg transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe
		 - Gradual decay of unmaintained building
		 - **NEW** if process leads io increase in entropy, process is spontaneous(energetically favorable)
		 - Even nonspontaneous processes contribute overall to entropy
	 - How does this apply to biology??????
		 - Living systems increase entropy
			 - How can living systems create solid patterns(polypeptides) if entropy must increase
			 - The organisim is net entropic bc they put so much entropy into their surroundings

##8.2 The free-energy change of a reaction tells us whether or not the reaction occurs spontaneously
### Free-Energy Change
 - Gibbs Free Energy = Free Energy = G = amount of systems energy that can perform work
 - $\Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S$
	 - $\Delta H$ = Enthalpy(total nrg)
	 - $\Delta S$ = change in system entropy
	 - $T$ is absolute temp in K
 - $\Delta G$ tells us if reaction spontaneous
 - $\Delta G$ negative if spontaneous
	 - $\Delta H$ must also be negative or $T\Delta S$ must be positive
### Free Energy, Stability Equlibrium
 - $\Delta G = G_{final \space state} - G_{initial\space state}$
 - Alternate way of determining $\Delta G$
 - Free energy is systems instability/likelihood to change to more stable state
 - There is potential to do work when $/Delta G$ is negative
 - Equlibrium = state of maximum stability
	 - forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate, no net change
	 - G is at lowest possible value
### Free Energy and Metabolisim
 - applying above to bio
 - Exergonic and endergonic reactions
	 - Exergonic reaction: Releases nrg, G decreases
		 -$\Delta G$ negative, **spontaneous**, does work
		 - Cell resp is exergonic, sopontaneous, glucose loses nrg to atp
	 - Endergonic reaction: Gains nrg, G increases
		 - Essentially sotres nrg in molecules($\Delta G \geq 0$)
		 - reverse of exergonic must be endergonic
		 - plants make sugar using nrg from sun
 - Equlibrium and metabolisim
	 - if a cell was in equlibrium it would not be functioning
	 - Cell NOT in eq
	 - Stop eq from happening by excreting waste byproducts, reusing all others

## 8.3 ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions
## Cellular Work
 - Chemical work(pushes endergonic reactions to happen)
 - Transport Work(pump molecules against membrane)
 - Mechanical work(movement of cilia)

### ATP Structure + Hydrolysis
 - Sugar ribose, Nitrogenous base adenine, chain of three phosphate groups
 - ATP + Water --> ADP + NRG
 - Ending phosphate broken off by water, phosphate($HOPO_3^{2-}$)
 - 1 mole starting atp releases 7.3 kcal nrg
 - Cells change the conditions from standard to release 78% more nrg from one atp
 - WHY so much nrg?
	 - Phosphate gps all (-) charged, mutually repulsing
	 - Act like compressed spring

### How ATP's nrg does work
 - In a test tube, hydrolyzed ATP just heats up
 - Useful for chemical, transport, mechanical work
 - Specififc enzymes use ATP to drive endergonic reactions(Chemical)
	 - Hydrolysis splits a phosphate from atp
	 - Phosphate attaches to reactant, destabilizes reaction
	 - Reactant+Phosphate = phosphorlyated intermediate
	 - Phosp. Int. more reactive
	 - Reaction becomes spontaneous
	 - net $\Delta G$ must be negative
 - Tansport+mechanical work
	 - Phosphorlyation of membrane proteins changes their shape, allows for pump action
	 - Phosphorlyation and dephosphorlyation of motor proteins on cell membrane makes them chg shape, move

### The Regeneration of ATP
 - Generated from ADP + pjosphate
 - Free energy to regen ATP comes from other exergonic breakdowns
 - Reaction must be endergonic bc ATP->ADP is exergonic
 - Bc of this, ATP is able to act as storage for nrg used for anabolism, allow it to be used for catabolisim

##8.4 Enzymes speed up metabolic reactions by lowering energy barriers

##How do cells lower nrg barriers to increase reaction rate
 - While techically anything wint $\Delta G < 0$ is spont, can occur slowly
 - With addition of enzyme(catalyst protein), speed up reaction
 - Ribosymes can function as enzymes

### The Activation Energy Barrier
 - Chemical reaction involves bond breaking and forming
 - Need to convert one reactant into a more unstable form, then it reacts, forms stable form, $\Delta G < 0$
 - Initial energy investment into a reaction is free energy of activation/avtivation energy/$E_A$
 - amount of nrg needed to push reactants to top of hill so they can fall downhill
 - increase in thermal nrg
	 - molecules collide more
	 - agitates atoms within molecules, makes them more likely to change
	 - when molecule has enough nrg to break apart, it is in Transition state
 - sometimes, activation barrier present; $\Delta G<0$, but need to get over 'hump' of activation nrg
	 - when reaction returns to stable state, nrg released
	 - formation of new bonds releases more nrg than was used to activate
	 - this type of reaction would occur spontaneously, but rarely, if ever

### How Enzymes Speed Up Reactions
 - Most Biological macromolecules have potential to breakdown spontantously, but at typical cell temp, not likely to get activationnrg
 - Cells use catalysts instead of heat to speed up reaction
 - Enzyme lowes $E_A$ barrier
 - Enzymes unique to a reaction
 - Enzymes only work on naturally spontaneous reactions
 - Enzyme+substrates => Enzyme-substrate complex => Enzyme+Products
 - end in ase
 - Shape of substrate matches shape of enzyme, ensyme-substrate specificity
 - Enzymes change between different shapes with different free nrg values
	 - Attracts different substrates
	 - Active site forms slightly to substrate(Induced FIt)
	 - Like a handshake, makes it work better

### Catalysis in the Enzyme's Active Site
 - Substrate held in place by weak interactions
 - Being held in place lowers $E_A$
 - substrates become products, are released
 - Active site avalible again
 - Most metabolic reactions are reversible, enzyme either forward of backward(whichever has $-\Delta G$)
 - Net to equlibrium
 - How lower $E_A$?
	 - Template for proper orientation
	 - stretch molecules to break correct bonds, helps reach transtion state without increasing nrg
	 - Change pH in active site
	 - Amino acids directly participate(directly bonding)
 - Rate depends on initial concentration/how fast reach active site
 - when all enzymes in a solution have reactants, solution saturated(only way to increase rate is to add more enzyme)

### Effects of Local Conditions on enzyme activity
 - Effects of Temp and pH
	 - Certian optimal conditions favor certian enzyme shapes
	 - To a point, temp. helps reaction rate bc increases collisions
		 - After point, temp. disrupts enzyme itself
		 - Each enzyme has optimal temerature
		 - most around human body temp
	 - Similar thing for pH(6-8)
		 - pepsin in stomach likes low pH
		 - would denature most proteins, but pepsin likes it
		 - trypsin in intestine, likes alkaline pH, would die in stomach
 - Cofactors
	 - nonprotein helpers
	 - can be bound tightly or loosely
	 - can donate electrons, etc
	 - if cofactor is organic, it is coenzyme
	 - vitamins are coenzymes or make up coenzymes
 - Enzyme inhibitors
	 - Competitive inhibition
		 - Inhibitor mimics substrate, steals active site
	 - Noncompetitive inhibition
		 - Inhibitor binds somewhere else, changes shape of active site
	 - toxins and poisins are irreversible inhibitors(sarin)
		 - Binds to R gp on serine, important to nervous system
		 - DDT and Parathion
		 - Antibiotics to bacteria
	 - Inhibitoion highly normal process

### Evolution of Enzymes
 - Enzymes are just proteins, so changes in DNA alter enzyme structure, if more adventantageous to environment, yadyada

## 8.5 Regulation of enzyme activity helps control metabolism
## How do cells control their metabolisim
### Allosteric regulation of enzymes
 - Regulatorly moleules have reversible noncompetitive inhibitors
 - Allosteric regulation where function altered by binding of a regulatory molecule to a seperate site(either inhibition or stimulation)
 - Allosteric Activation and Inhibition
	 - Enzymes that are allostericlly regulated have 2 subunits
		 - Allosteric site is where subunits join
		 - Bonding of activator to allosteric site stabilizes shape
		 - Bonding of inhibitor stabilizes inactive form
		 - When nothing bonded, oscillates btw 2, can be stabilized by substrate
	 - Inhibitors and activators are often specific chemicals involved in a reaction(ATP+ADP)
		 - this creates feedback loop, if need more ATP, ADP activates enzyme, vice versa
	 - In a multisubunit enzyme, substrate bonding can solidify other active sites
 - Feedback Inhinition
	 - ATP-ADP ex. feedback inhibition

### Localization of Enzymes Within the Cell
 - cell is compartmentalized, sturctures organize metabolic pathways
 - Arrangement of enzymes forms chain of rections
 - Some enzymes have fixed positions that are intentional
