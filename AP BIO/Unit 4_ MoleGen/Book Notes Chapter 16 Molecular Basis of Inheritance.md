Book Notes Chapter 16 Molecular Basis of Inheritance

# Chapter 16
 - How does DNA replication transmit Genetic information
 - Chromosomes made up od DNA
	 - Each gene is specific DNA sequence
 - Replication begins
 - Replication begins at multiple sites, forms bubbles with forks
 - DNA DUplicated and condensed into chromosome(2 DNA Molecs+Proteins)

## 16.1 DNA is THE Genetic Material
 - TH Morgan showed genes exist in chromosomes, ppl think genetic material made up of either DNA or Proteins bc they make up chromosomes
 - Genetic Material From DNA or Protein?
	 - Little known abt neucleotides, seemed to have too little variety
	 - Proteins known to have much specificity
	 - How we figured out DNA
		 - Saw Bacteria killed with heat then mixed with other bacteria, traits mixed
			 - Later identified as DNA transfered
			 - Less likely to be proteins bc the proteins denatured with the heat
		 - Marked virus proteins with radioactive sulfur, saw proteins didnt go into cell, marked DNA with radioactive Phosphorus, did go into cell
			 - Also could tell that OG DNA kept playing a role bc saw radioactive isotopes later on as well
		 - Discovered different organisims had different percent amounts of Adenine
			 - also discovered same amount of A+T, G+C
 - Structural modeling
	 - Watson sees/steals rosalyn franklins x-ray diffraction image of DNA, realizes helical
		 - Watson and crick built models of double helix using X-ray and Chargaffs AC50 GT50 rule
		 - Watson constructed molecule with antiparallel sugarphosphte backbones on OUTSIDE of center
		 - For pairings, 2 Purines were wider than x-ray suggested, 2 Pyrimidines too small

## 16.2 Many proteins work together in DNA replication and repair
 - Neucleotides are unique in being able to control own replication as a monomer
 - DNA extremley suited to being replicated
 - Base Pairing to a Template Strand
	 - Know hydrogen bonds are broken, strands unwind, each chain acts as template for new strain
	 - This is semiconservative, predicted by watson+crick
	 - Conservative is parental strands come back together after forming new strands
	 - Dispersivee is all strands made up of mix of new and old DNA
 - DNA is replicated very fast and VERY Accurately
	 - Replication starts at origins of replication with specific neucleotide sequences
	 - In circular Bacteria and linear eukaryotic chromosomes, this makes a replication bubble, replicated in both directions until fuses with another bubble
	 - At ends of each bubble, Replication Fork 
		 - Helicases untwist DNA
		 - Single-strand binding proteins bind to each side, prevent repairing
		 - Topoisomerase releves strain on paired DNA ahead of replication fork
	 - RNA primer prodced by primase to start replication by DNA Polymerase III
	 - DNA Polymerase can only add to 3' end not 5'(5'->3' direction)
	 - strand with 3's closer to fork is continious/leading replication/strand
	 - on lagging strand, also goes in 5' to 3', but faces away from fork
	 - Lagging strand synthesized discontinously in okazaki fragments
	 - DNA POL 1 removes RNA primer and replaces with DNA
	 - DNA Ligase joins Okazaki Fragments
 - Proofreading + Reparing DNA
	 - "mismatch repair" - polymerases other than 1+3 check neucleoties vs template strand, replace if needed
	 - Incorrect stuff after replication (xrays, spontaeous changes) usually corrected before become permenant mutations
	 - Ususally strand is cut out by nuclease, then gap is refilled with nucleotides by DNA Pol and lig
	 - Mutations that disable DNA repair are very bad
	 - After a mutation makes it through one generation of replication, it is undetectable
 - Fixing DNA ends(3'-5')
	 - RNA Primers on ends of DNA cannot be replaced because no way to go from 5'-3', so strand ends up shorter
	 - Telomeres used at end of DNA to prevent actual stuff from being eaten
	 - over time we have many shorter telomeres, tell age with this
	 - WHAAAAT
	 - After second replication, you cant tell
	 - Prokaryotes dont need telomeres bc circular genes means stuff

## 16.3 Chromosomes are DNA + Proteins
	 - Chromosomes carry the genetic info
	 - Bacterial chromosome is just the circular DNA, few proteins
	 - In bacteria, DNA coils and Supercoils to condense with ceritian proteins
	 - In Eukaryotic cells, Chromatin(DNA+many proteins)
		 - Chromatin is made up of neuclesome "beads" where DNA is wound twice around 8 histones(2x 4 histone types)
		 - Amino/tail end of histone extends out from nucleosome, used in gene expression regulation
		 - Neucleosome is 10nm in diamater(10nm fiber is chromatin)
		 - Euchromatin is when these are in a spaced out, neat line, heterochromatin is when they are chaotic dense
	 - In Prophase, chromatin starts out in 2 sister chromatids, condenses with condensin II+I
		 - Condensin II binds to 10nm chromatin, form chromatin loops from condensin scafold, folding into many little loops

	 - In prometaphase, Condensin 1 proteins make smaller loops, further condensing infividual loops, also causing the scaffold to helicate
	 - Fully condensed in metaphase

	 - Looser packed euchromatin is more accessable to be transcripted and translated
