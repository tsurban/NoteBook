Chapter 19 Viruses

##19.1Describe a virus.
 - A virus consists of a nucleic acid surrounded by a protein coat
 - Most viruses are smaller and simpler than other cells
 - Viruses first observed with plant illnesses not killed by bacteria-killing things
	 - Showed that could not be cultivated on simple agar plate, needed other organisms
	 - Virus crystalized, seen
 - Virus Structure
	 - Smallest viruses only 20nm
	 - Most expirements done on bacteria-infecters
	 - Viruses helped demonstrate that genes made out of nucleic acids, Replication, transcrip/translation
	 - Viral Genomes
		 - Viruses can have double or single stranded DNA or RNA
		 - Arranged in single linear or circular neucleic acid, from 3->2000 units/genes
	 - Capsids and Envelopes
		 - Protein shell enclosing viral genome is capsid
		 - Capsids are built from capsomeres(Subunits), commonly all proteins are identical
		 - Accessory infectious aspects
			 - Membranous envelope around influenza capsids
			 - Viral envelops contain host phospholipids+membrane proteins+proteins & glycoproteins(With starch atched)
		 - Some viruses carry viral enzymes like viral polymerase in capsids

##19.2Explain how viruses replicate and evolve.
 - Viruses replicate only in host cells
 - Lack metabolic pathways for self sustenance
 - Obligate intracellular parasites
 - Each virus can only infect a specific subset of species(host range)
 - Identify host cells by a handshake btw viral surface proteins+surface receptor molecules on outside of cells
 - Gemeral Features of Viral REplicative cycles
	 - Infection beins when viral genome enters host cell
	 - Method of entry depends on type of virus+host(T-even phages use tail apparatus)
		 - Some taken in by endocytosis
		 - if virus has membrane, membranes can fuse w/host's
 - Replicative cycles of phages
	 - best understood and most complex viruses
	 - two alternative replicaition mechanisms(lytc cycle+lysogenic cycle)
	 - lytic cycle
		 - Culminates in death of host cell
		 - Last stage, bacterium lyses+releases phages
		 - Phage that only uses lytic cycle is virulent phage
	 - Lysogenic cycle
		 - Phages coexist with host in lysogeny
		 - Allows replication of phage without destoying host, coexist in lysogeny
		 - Using both is temperate phage, model organism is lambda or $\lambda$
	 - Phage $\lambda$ 
		 - Infects ecoli
		 - Binds to surface, injects linear DNA genome
		 - $\lambda$ DNA forms circle within host
		 - if during lytic cycle, host immediately turned into $\lambda$ producing all ends
			 - Can be switched to lytic by certian signal or radiation
		 - Lysogenic cycle, $\lambda$ molecule DNA incoperated into ecoli chromosome as prophage
			 - Prophage inhibits prophage production, e.coli divide with prophages in them, slowly producing
			 - Prophage can code for something making ecoli toxic to humans
	 - Bactterial defenses
		 - Natural selection favors bacteria without receptors detected by phages
		 - Phage DNA often eliminated by restriction enzymes
		 - Crispr-Cas9 cuts it, stores phage genome, remembers to cut it next time
 - Replicative cycles of Animal viruses
	 - Like other viruses, can only replicate in host cells
	 - Variations depend on double/single stranded dna/rna, envelope presence
	 - Many animal viruses have both rna and envelope
	 - Viral envelopes
		 - Enters thru fusing membranes
		 - Uses rough ER membranes
		 - Like exocytosis, new capsids wropped in membrane as leave cell
		 - Dosent nessecarily kill cell
		 - Herpes viruses use golgi for membraane, replicate within nucleus
	 - Viral Genetic Material chart classification
	 - Retroviruses are most complicated
		 - Enzyme reverse transcriptase transcribes RNA onto DNA copy(HIV/AIDS)
		 - Hiv enters cell, catalyzes synthesis of viral DNA
		 - Viral DNA enters nucleus, integrates into chromosome(provirus)
		 - Never leaves host genome, remains permenant resident
 - Evoltion of viruses
	 - Despite being nonliving, still evolve
	 - Appeared after host-cells appeared
	 - Og sources of genomes are plasmids(in bacteria, seperate from genome) or transposons(DNA segmetns that can move around in genome)(all mobile genetc elements)
	 - COnsistent with some irus DNA being virtually idenetical to host
	 - Some larger viruses have been found recently with more modern features, did they steal it...?

##19.3Use examples to illustrate the effects of animal and plant viruses, as well as prions, on their hosts.
 - Viral Disease in Animals
 - Damage or kill cells by releasing hydrolytic enzymes from lysosomes
 - Lasting viral damage depends on ability of tissue to repair(respritory tract can repair good)
 - Polio to nerve cells is baaad
 - Immune system causes temporary symptoms
 - Vaccines use immune systems by stimulating them
	 - Curing Viruses is still impossible
	 - Most drugs try to interfere with nucleic acid synthesis, inhibits viral polymerase
 - Emerging viral diseases
	 - Viruses that suddenly become apparent are emerging viruses
	 - Rapid virus strain creation/spread is bc high mutation rate
	 - Human development allowing for spread(HIV)
	 - Spread from other animals(H1N1)
		 - H1N1 was mix from many divverent
		 - Flu viruses change quickly bc have 9 rna segments rather than one
	 - Change in host behavior or environment changes increase viral traffic, potential spread
	 - Mosquitos are big transmitter, has been mvmnt to stop mosquitos from biting ppl
 - Viral diseases in plants
	 - Crop diestuction(brown spots, stunted growth, etc)
	 - Same basic structure and replication as animal viruses
	 - Plant protected by epidermis, is more succeptable if damaged
	 - Herbivores+insects also carrry viruses from plant to plant
 - Prions: Proteins as Infectious agents
	 - Viruses are infectious, spread diseases, made up of nucleic acid genitics
	 - Infectious proteins, cause degenerative brain disease in some animals
	 - infect by eating meat w/ proteins
	 - Prions act slowly, arent destroyed by heat
	 - Are misfolded forms of protein normally expressed in brain cells, prion converts good proteins into prions, creates aggregate cinokec vonberting more
