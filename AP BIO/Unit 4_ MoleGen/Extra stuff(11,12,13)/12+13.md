12+13

### CONCEPT 12.1: Most cell division results in genetically identical daughter cells
 - Unicellular organisims reproduce with cell division, multicellular organisims use cell division for growth from fertilized egg and for repair
 - Genome is partitioned into chromosomes
	 - Each chromosome holds one DNA molecule coding for many proteins
	 - DNA+Proteins is called chromatin
	 - Chromatin exists in different states of condensation at different times
	 - Animal gametes have one set of chromosomes, somatic cells have 2 sets
 - DNA(chromatids) in different shapes at diff times
	 - Replicated in looser lines
	 - Mitosis/the pulley-apart bit needs them to be more condensed
 - Cells replicate genetic material before divide, each daughter cell gets one set of DNA
	 - Before cell division, chromosomes duplicated into 2 identical sister chromatids joined along length by cohesins(sister chromatid cohesion)
	 - Chromatids held together mostly at centromere constricted region of repetitive sequences in DNA
	 - When ^^ cohesion is broken, chromatids separate, become daughter cell chromosomes
	 - Mitosis is division of nucleus, cytokensis is division of cytoplasm

### 12.2: Mitotic Phase alternates with interphase in the cell cycle
 - Cell division(mitosis) is shortest phase in the cell cycle
 - Parts of cell cycle not cell division are interphase(G1, S, G2)
	 - G1 is most variable in length
	 - S phase is longest
 - Cell grows dring interphase, DNA is replicated in S phase
 - Prophase->Prometaphase->metaphase->anaphase->telophase and cytokinesis
 - Mitotic spindle(microtubules) controls chromosome mvmnt during mitosis
	 - Material for spindle provided by(partial) dissolution of cytoskeleton
	 - Assembly starts at centrosome w/ material to organize microtubules
		 - Pair of centrioles are in center of centrosome, but are not nessecary for Spindle Fiber formation
	 - Centrosome duplicates in interphase
	 - Move apart from nucleus in Prophase and prometaphase as microtubules grow
	 - End of prometaphase, one at each side of cell
		 - Have aster(short spread of microtubules)
	 - Kinetochores are places on each sister chromatid where kinetochore microtubules join
	 - Pull from each side forming metaphase plate
	 - Nonkinetochore microtubules overlap
	 - Anaphase, cohesins cleaved by separase, chromatids become individual chromosomes
		 - Pushed to the ends along mTubules by motor proteins(Pacman mechanism)
		 - Reeled in by motor proteins at spindle poles
	 - Nonkinetochore Microtubules(overlapping) push apart, moving spindle poles apart

 - In animal cells, mitotic spindle comes from centrosomes, includes spindle microtubules and asters
	 - Spindle microtubules attach to kinetochores of chromosomes, mve them to metapase plate(middle)
	 - Once sister chromatids separate, motor proteins move them along the spindle microtubules to opposite ends of cell
	 - Cell elongates when other microtubules push against opposite sides of cell, push cell out from inside
	 - Mitosis is followed by cytokenisis(clevage in animal cells, cell plate in plant cells)
	 - In bacterial binary fission, chromosome replicates and daughter chromosomes move apart, proteins related to eukaryotic actin and tubulin
 - G2
	 - Nuclear envelope encloses nucleus
	 - Nucleus contains >1 nucleoli
	 - 2 centrosomes formed by duplication f 1 centrosome
	 - Chromosomes have not been condensed yet
 - Prophase
	 - Chromatin fibers become more tightly coiled, visible with light mcscope
	 - Nucleoli dissapear
	 - Sister chromatids appear, joined at centromere + along arms by cohesins(sister chromatid cohesion)
	 - Mitotic spindle begins to form, composed of centrosomes and microtubules, many smaller offshoots called asters
	 - Centrosomes move away from eachother by lengthening microtubules
 - Prometaphase
	 - Nuclear envelope fragments
	 - Microtubules invade nuclear area
	 - Chromosomes are even more condensed
	 - Kinetochore forms at centromere of each chromatid(2 per chromosome)
	 - Some microtubules atch to kinetochores, move chromosomes back+forth
	 - non kinetochore mTubules interact with opposite mtubule, push, elongate cell
 - Metaphase
	 - Centrosomes now at opposite poles of cell
	 - Chromosomes along metaphase plate
	 - All Kinetochores of chromatids attached to kinetochore microtubules 
 - Anaphase
	 - Shortest stage
	 - Cohesin proteins are cleaved, sister chromatids part suddenly, each becomes own chromosome
	 - kinetochoremicrotubules shorten, pull chromosomes to either end of cell
	 - non kinetochoremicrotubules continue to elongate cell
 - telophase
	 - two daughter nuclei form
	 - Nuclear envelopes arise from gragments of parent cell envelope
	 - nucleoli reappear
	 - Chromosomes become less condensed
	 - remaining spindles depolymerized
	 - Mitosis is complete
 - Cytokensis
	 - Already started by telophase ends
	 - cytohensis different in animals in plants(clevage furrow vs wall divide)
	 - First sign of leaage is cleavage furrow(peach)
		 - in cytoplasm, contractile ring of actins associated with myosin protein
		 - Actins interact with myosins, contracting ring(like pulling drawstring)
		 - Furrow deepens until parent cell pinched in two

	 - Plant vesicles from golgi move along microtubules to middle fo cell, coalece to form cell plate, collecting cell wall material as it grows
 - Binary Fission
	 - Means asexual reprodution of single-celled eukaryotes AND bacteria
	 - Most genes in bacteria carried on single chromosome(plasmid)
	 - Replication of chromosome occurs at origin of replication(you know this)
	 - While DNA replicates, cell elongates
	 - Proteins cause plasma membrane to pinch closed
	 - How chromosomes move is still researched, likely bc of actin-like thing
 - Binary fission preceded mitosis
	 - Intermediate stages found in unusual nuclear divisions by dinoflagellates(microtubules pass thru nucleus), diatoms(microtubules are within nucleus), some yeasts
	 - Nuclear envelope reains intact
	 - Likely more intermediates in extinct species
### 12.3 the eukaryotic cell cycle is regulated by a molecular control system
 - signaling molecules present in cytoplasm regulate cell cycle progress
 - cyclic changes in regulatory proteins work as clock
 - Checkpoints used as stopping points until go-ahead given in G1, G2, M phases
	 - Can be regulated by internal and external control
	 - Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent kinases do rhythymic regulation
	 - Cyclin rises in S and G2 and falls in M phase
	 - Kinase is active only when attached to cyclin(protein that fulcuates in concentration in cell)
	 - ^^ are cyclin dependent kinases or Cdks
	 - MPF is first discovered Cdk, controls start of M phase
	 - Cyclin accumulates in late S phase, is protected from degredation
	 - late G2, cyclin combines with CDK, making MPF to start M phase
		 - MPF starts M phase by phosphorylating various proteins
		 - Cyclin in MPF is degraded in anaphase
		 - Cyclin degredation cntinues in G1

	 - Checkpoints are built-in stop signals, report whether needeed proceses have been completed correctly
	 - If pass g1, usually does S+G2 fine, if fail, go G0
	 - M checkpoint id suring prometaphase, stops if any chromosome not attached to spindle fibers(regulated by other non cyclin proteins)
	 - S phase checkpont stops DNA damaged cells
	 - A->T phase ensures split
	 - Wont happen in lack of nutrients/sometimes if no growth factor signal
	 - Density dependedent inhibition/crowded cells stp dividing
	 - Anchorage dependence, need to be attached to something to grow
 - Cancer cells
	 - Do not stop dividing in absence of growth factors(either dont need or produce own)
	 - Can keep dividing indefinitely with nutrients
	 - Cells given ability to divide indefinitely have undergone transformation process, behave like cancer cells
	 - Other cells just divide 20-50 times
	 - Most cancer cells targeted, aptosised by normal cells
	 - If evade apoptosis, may remain at og site, dont move around(benign)
	 - Malignant tumor spreads cells to new organs
		 - May have werid chromosome numbers
		 - May have werid metabolism, may stop being productive
		 - May also secrete signals encouraging blood vessel growth towards tumor
	 - X-rays hurt cancer cells more bc have lost ability to fix dna
	 - Chemo drugs interfere with cell cycle steps
 - Most cells exhibit density-dependent inhibition of cell division and anchorage dependence
	 - Density dependent inhibition causes cells to stop dividing when crowded together
	 - Anchorage depencence is when cells need to be attached to something to divide
	 - Cancers do neither
 - Cancer cells skip checkpoints, form tumors, can undergo metasisis, cancer exported to other sites

### 13.1 - CONCEPT 13.1: Offspring acquire genes from parents by inheriting chromosomes
 - Each Gene codes for specific enzymes or proteins, cumulative action of enzymes/proteins determines traits
 - Humans have 46 chromosomes in somatic cells(all cells except gametes and gamete precursors)
	 - One chromosome codes for hundreds->thousands of genes
 - Each Gene exists in a specific locus on a certain chromosome
 - In asecual reproduction, a single parent produces identical offspring by mitosis
	 - Can happen in single cell eukaryotes or a fewl multicellular organisms(hydras(budding) + certian trees like redwoods)
 - Sexual reproduction combines genes from 2 parents, diversifies offspring
 - Are the G1, S, and G2 phases similar in mitotically dividing cells and meitotically dividing cell(yes)
 - How does meta/anaphase 1 mechanically work w/x+y chromosomes(same)
 - in a cell with 2n = 6, mitosis metaphase plate has 6 chromosomes, meiosis metaphase 1+2 plate has 3 chromosomes()

### 13.2: Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles
 - Normal human somatic cells are diploid(2 sets of 23 chromosomes)
	 - Each set has same length, centromere position, staining pattern(same genes at same locuses)
	 - Ordered display of chromosomes by length is a karyotype
	 - X and Y chromosomes are exceptions, only small parts of X and Y are homologous
	 - 46 somatic chromosomes are actually 2x 23(maternal and paternal sets)(n=23, 2n = 46)
	 - Cell with duplicated 2n after S phase still 2n bc only 2 sets of unique info
 - Meiosis creates haploids, fertilization creates diploids
 - In humans and most animals gametes are the only haploids
 - Alternation of generations, multicellular diploid(sporophyte) AND haploid stages(spores)
	 - Spores produced by meiosis of sporophyte
	 - Haploid spore divides mitotically into gametophyte(multicellular haploid stage), mitotis into gametes
	 - Fusion of gametes makes diploid zygote, produces sporophyte
 - In fungi and some protists
	 - Gametes fuse into diploid zygote, meiosis happens without multicellular diploid(mitosis dosent happen)
	 - ^^ Produces unicellular decendants or haploid multicellular adult
	 - Haploid mitosises, producing gametes
 - Ovaries and testes produce haploid gametes by meiosis
 - During Fertilization, egg and sperm unite, form zygote
 - Sexual life cycles differ in timing of meiosis relative to fertilization and in web a multicellular organisim is produced
 - 23 sets of homologous chromosomes

### CONCEPT 13.3: Meiosis reduces the number of chromosome sets from diploid to haploid
WHY IS THE DNA BROKEN
 - Meiosis 1 reduces to haploid cell, meiosis 1+2 make 4 haploid cells
 - Different from mitosis bc meiosis I events of prophase I, Metaphase 1, Anaphase 1
 - Synaptonemal complex holds homologs together
	 - Facilitates crossing over at dna breaks(at chismata)
 - Prophase I
	 - Homologs associate loosely initially, then held with synaptonemal complex(synapsis)
	 - Each pair of homologous chromosomes undergoes synapsis+crossing over, then chiasmata appear
		 - Synapsis is homologous sister chromatid pairs join for metaphase, cross over 
		 - Chiasmata are places where crossing over happens
		 - At least one crossover must ocur for tetrad to stay together at metaphase plate
		 - Anaphase 1: homologs seperate, sister chromatids remain joined+haploid
 - Then Meiosis II seperates sister chromatids
 - Chiasmata hold homologs together until anaphase I

### CONCEPT 13.4: Genetic variation produced in sexual life cycles contributes to evolution
 - Genetic variation happens thru sexual reproduction with crossing over, random fertilization, independent assortment(chromosomes can be in either cell produced by meiosis 1)
 - Most of variation between generation is bc meiosis and fertilization
 - Independent assortment(50% chance you get maternal chromosome for any given chromosome, 50% paternal)
	 - Number of possiblle assortments is 2^n(determined by metaphase 1)
 - Crossing Over
	 - each chromosome is not exclusively maternal or paternal(After prophase I)
	 - Crossing over produces recombinant chromosomes
	 - Average of 1-3 crossing overs occurs per tetrad
 - Random fertilization ya know
 -
