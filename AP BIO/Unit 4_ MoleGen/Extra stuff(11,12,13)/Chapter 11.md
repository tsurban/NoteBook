Chapter 11

##11.1 External signals are converted to responses within the cell
 - Signaling mechanisms first evloved in ancient prokaryotes+protists, then adapted for multicellular organisims
 - Singlaing is essential to prokaryotes
	 - Cells secrete molecules that can be detected
	 - Concentration of signaling mmolecules allows bacteria to monitor own density(quorum sensing)
	 - Allows bacteria to coordinate behavior of all cells ina population
		 - When prokaryotes are dense enough together, form biofilm, start secreting molecules to attach selves to each other + surface
		 - Biofilms form on teeth, slimy bit on a log
	 - Also used in toxin secretion by infectious bacteria
		 - Signaling used to start toxin secretion is being targeted to counter antibiotic resistance
	 - Yeasts(single-celled fungi)
		 - Indentify mates by chemically signaling
		 - Each cell type(a and $\alpha$) secretes different factor, only binds to other type
		 - When exposed to mating factor, cells change shape, grow together+nmate
		 - Match btw factor and receptor ensures mating between only same species
	 - Steps from recieving signal to action are reception, transduction, response(singal transduction pathway)
 - Local and Long-Distance Signaling
	 - Multicellular organism cells communicate with signaling molecules
	 - Cells may or may not be adjacent(local or long-distance)
	 - Many cells have junctions directly connecting cytoplasms or jouned by integral proteins
	 - Local signaling 
		 - When uses molecules traveling short distances in animals is called paracine signaling
			 - Multiple cells can respond to signals coming from one cell
		 - Synaptic signaling in nervous system
			 - Electrical signal along nerve cell triggers neurotransmitter molecules
			 - neurotransmitters diffuse across synapse, trigger response in targe cell
	 - Long distance signaling
		 - Hormones used for long dist signaling in animals and plants
		 - Animals, endocirne signaling
			 - Specalized cells release hormones, travel around circulatory system+thru 
		 - Plant hormones travel through cells, vary widely in size+type
		 - When target cell is exposed to signaling molecule, ability to recieve is affected by if has receptor
 - How does signal activate enzyme
	 - adrenaline encourages breakdown of glycogen
	 - Adrenaline activates glycogen phosphorlase only if cell is present(indicates receptor needed as intermediate)
	 - Signal REception
		 - Target cell detects singaling molecule
		 - Molecule binds to receptor protein
	 - Signal transduction
		 - Binding of singlaing molecule changes receptor protein, initates transduction
		 - Converts signal to form that brings about specific response
		 - Sometimes is single step, often requires series of changes(signal transduction pathway)
	 - Cellular response
		 - Transduced signal triggers specific respinse

##11.2 Signal reception: A signaling molecule binds to a receptor, causing it to change shape
 - Reception of singla depends on reciver(a signals only heard by $\alpha$ recivers)
 - Signaling molecule acts as ligand(molecule binds to another(often larger) molecule)
 - Receptors in the Plasma Membrane
	 - Largest family of human cell-surface receptors are G protein-coupled receptors(GPCRs), >800 diff GPCRs
	 - Most water-soluble signaling moleules bind to specific sites that transmit info from outside to the inside
		 - G protein sits on inside of membrane, can move around
		 - GCPRs hold G protein GDP, when GDP becomes GTP+signaling molecule is in receptor, GCPR makes G protein dephosphorylate, use nrg to activate enzyme and return to state
			 - G protein binds to GTP, makes use of nrg
		 - Many different signaling molecules use GPCRs
		 - All GPCRs are pretty similar, make up large family of receptor proteins with each polypeptide having 7 alpha helicies, specific loops form binding sites
		 - Malfunctions are involved in many diseases+infections
	 - Receptor Tyrosine Kinases(RTKs)
		 - Belong to major class or receptors that have enzymati activity
		 - Catalyzes transfer of phosphate groups from ATP to another protein
		 - When Signal molecle bonds, >10  transduction pathways can happen, usually triggered one at a time
		 - Each tyrone kinase is a monomer, when signaling molecules bond, they join together as dimer
		 - Dimerization activats tyrosine kinase region, each kinase adds an ATP phospate to tyrosine at tail of other monomer(Fully activates it)
		 - Fully activated receptor is regognised by relay proteins inside cell
	 - Ion CHannel REceptors
		 - Ligand-Gated ion CHannel is membrane channel containing gate region, gate is opened by presence of singaling molecule(ligand)
		 - Gate opens, allows ions thru
		 - When ligand dissociates, channel closes
		 - Very important for nervous system, allows ions thru to create electrical signals
	 - Many diseases caused at these places
		 - Abnormal RTK functioning associated with cancers
 - Intracelular receptors
	 - Receptor proteins in cytoplasm or in nucleus
	 - Signaling molecule must pass thru target cell membrane(either small enough or hydrophobic enough to cross interior)(stereroid hormnes and thyroid hormones and Nitric oxide(a gas))
	 - Changes receptor into hormone-receptor complex, causes response by turning on or off genes
	 - targets transcription factors

##11.3 Signal transduction: Cascades of molecular interactions transmit signals from receptors to relay molecules in the cell
 - Trans-Membrane proteins have complex transduction pathway, greatly amplifies signal to activate more molecules+have more opportunities for control
 - Signal Transduction Pathways
	 - Signaling molecule binding is first step of many dominoes leading to response
	 - Protein-Protein interactions are major component of cell signaling transduction
	 - At each step, signal is transduced into next protein often using phosphorylation
 - Protein Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation[Chapter 11](../../../../JUNIOR%20YEAR(Bleh)/AP%20BIO/Unit%204_%20MoleGen/Extra%20stuff(11,12,13)/Chapter%2011.md)
	 - Protein transfering phosphates from ATP to protein is a protein kinase
	 - RTK is specific kind of kinase, differs btw most dont phosphrorylate Tyrosine, instead do proteins or Serine or Threonine
	 - Phosphorulation cascade is when lotsa
		 - Signal transmitted by cascade of phosphorylations
		 - Kinases activating each others until get to protein, make it active
		 - Started by signal protein binding to receptor
		 - Proteoin phosphatases rapidly remove phosphate groups+reenable protein kinases for use(dephosphyrylation)
 - Small Molecules and Ions as Second Messengers
	 - Small nonprotein, water soluable messengers or ions called second messengers bc first messenger is extracellular signal/ligand
	 - Participate in pathways initiated by GPCRs and RTKs
	 - Cyclic AMP
		 - Binding of epinepherine to GPCR resulted in increase in cAMP
		 - ADenylyl cyclase creates cAMP from ATP upon signaling by G protein, convreted back to normal AMP by phosphodiesterasez
		 - some g proteins inhibit adenylyl cyclase, fine  tune btw the two
		 - Disease cased by prevention/general messing with G protein+imbalances
 - Calcium ions and inositol Triphosphate
	 - Most signaling molecules in amimals induce responses thru concentration of calcium ions
		 - Used for secretion, light response, division
		 - calcium used in pathways with GPCR and RTKs
		 - Concentration in cell is much lower than otside
		 - Cytosolic calcium level rises bc of inositol triphosphate(IP_3) and dicylgycerol(DAG)

##11.4 Cellular response: Cell signaling leads to regulation of transcription or cytoplasmic activities
 - Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Responses
	 - Many pathways ultimately regulate protein synth, target transcription
		 - Can stop like w/ aldesterone, stop transcription factors from working
		 - Can encourage w/ kinase cascade activating transcription factor
	 - Sometimes regulates activity of proteins rather than their synthesis(outside nucleus proteins)
		 - byproduct can act as activator for allosteric enzyme
 - Regulation of the response
	 - Signaling pathways amplify cell response to single signaling event
	 - Many steps in the pathway provide ample opportunity for regulation
 - Overall efficency is enhanced by scaffolding proteins
 - Signal Amplification
	 - Elaborate enzyme cascades amplify cell signal response, kinases trigger tens of other kinases
	 - cAMPs do the same
 - Specifity of signaling and coordination of response
	 - Liver cell + Heart cells need to do similar things, prompted by unique signals
	 - Different kinds of cells turn on different sets of genes, so different kinds of cells have different collections of proteins
	 - Response to signal depends on specific signal receptor proteins, relay proteins, proteins needed to respond
	 - Within cells, paths branch or converge, even with same molecules, differnces in other proteins account for different responses
	 - Branched responses often use RTKs or 2nd messengers
 - Signaling efficency: Scaffolding proteins and signaling complexes
	 - Scaffolding proteins are large relay proteins to which several other relay proteins are simultaneously atched
	 - Some cases, scaffoldng proteins directly activate relay proteins
	 - RElay proteins as points of branching or intersection in signaling pathways shown by what happens when missing(bad things)
 - Termination of the signal
	 - Inactiveation mechanisms are essntial to pathway
	 - Each molec change must last only a short time
	 - Time until ready to recive new signal depends on how reversable change was
	 -Binding of signaling molecules is reversible, as external concentration of signals falls, fewer receptors bound, less production, everything reset

##11.5 Apoptosis requires integration of multiple cell-signaling pathways
 - Initally, pathways thought to be linear, independent
 - Now realise signaling compnentss interact with each other
 - Apoptosis as example
	 - Happens to cells when end functional lifespan
	 - celular agents cut up DNA and fragment organelles+cytoplasmic compnents
	 - Cell shrinks, becomes lobed, packaged into vesicles and digested by scavenger cells
	 - Signal comes from either outside or inside cell
		 - Outside, other molecules releasedcan initate transduction pathway for genes responsible for death
		 - In cell, protein-protein interactions pass along signal also signaling cell death
		 - Examples f apoptosishelp us see how pathways integrated
		 - 2 key opoptosis genes(ced3&4)/capsases in worms, usually inactive but present as proteins, must be activated by signals
		 - In humans, 15 diff capsases, pathway used depends on type of cell+signal initating apoptosis
		 - One major one causes holes in mitochandria, causing leakage of toxic molecules
		 - Cytochrome C acts as mitochandrial electron transport in healthy cells, as death factor when released from mitochondria
		 - Relay proteins integrate several different sources, send cell down pthway
		 - signals can come from nucleus when DNA suffered irreprable damage or ER when excessive protein
