## Intro: The Origin of Species
***
### **24.1**: How does a new species form?
Normally:
 - Different populations are connected thru interbreeding individuals
 - This means that when a trait is naturally selected for, all populations get this trait

New species circumstances:
 1. Something seperates the populations such that no interbreeding occurs(Barrier to **Gene flow**)
 2. Population **diverges genetically**, causing traits advantageous for the one population not to spread to the others
 3. Population becomes **Reproductively Isolated**, considered new species.

### How does **speciation** work
 - One species splits into two
 - Many traits shared
	 - Flightless comorant on Galapagos
	 - Shared much DNA with *ancestors* in Americas
 - Bridge between microevolution(small scale natural selection) and macroevolution(broad pattern of evolution)

### Definition of species
*A group of populations who have the potential to interbreed in nature and produce viable, fertile offspring.*


 - All Humans are a species because any one human can mate with another human
 - Humans and Chimpanzees are not a species because humans cannot mate with Chimps despite large DNA similarities

### What holds a species together(**Gene Flow**)
 - Gene flow occurs as interbreeding between different populations of a species
 - Transfers allels, keeps everyone's DNA relatively similar
 - Lack of  **Gene Flow** / **Reproductive Isolation**
	 - *Biological barriers prevent members of 2 species from interbreeding*
	 - Limit formation of  **Hybrids**, isolate species gene pool
	 - Some examples:
		 1. **Habitat Isolation** - Breed in different places(strawberry fly vs. blueberry fly)
		 2. **Temporal Isolation** - Breed during different daytimes, seasons, years
		 3. **Species-Unique Behaviors** - Only specific species interested in certian courtship behavior
		 4. **Mechanical isolation** - different incompatable mechanisims for breeding
		 5. **Gametic Isolation** - Sperm not able to fertilize eggs of other species
		 6. **Reduced Hybrid Viability** - Hybrids not likely to live long
		 7. **Reduced Hybrid Fertility** - Hybrids unable to reproduce, think Mule
		 8. **Hybrid Breakdown** - Over generations, hybrid species becomes less viable or fertile
	 - **Prezygotic Barriers** - Block sperm and egg from getting together(1-5)
	 - **Postzygotic Barriers** - Make sperm and egg infertile in some way(6-8)
 - Limitations to the reproductive isolation Speciation theory
	 - Can't be used in fossils
	 - Dosen't apply to asexually reproducing organisims(prokaryotes, im looking at u)
	 - Some things we consider different species that can have offspring sucessfully
	 - (Grizzly bear +Polar bear == Grolar bear)

### Other definitions of species
 - Other definitions emphasize unity within species rather than difference btw diff
	 - Morphological species concept*(based on body shape and structure)*
		 - Applies to asexual organisims too
		 - No need to know gene flow
		 - Bad bc relies on subjective criteria
	 - Ecological species concept*(Based on ecological niche)*
		 - Disregards gene flow
		 - Looks at ecological conditions of existance(wet/dry, etc)
		 - Emphasizes role of disruptive natural selection? -- **WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**
	 - >20 other definitions

## Key Concept 24.1:The biological species concept emphasizes reproductive isolation
***
## **24.2** Types of speciation
- **Allopatric Speciation** : Geographically isolated populations
- **Sympatric Speciation** : No geographical isolation
- **Allopatric** ("Other Country") **Speciation** 
	1. Physical barrier size porportional to mobility of organisims
	2. Different mutations arise
	3. Natural selection and genetic drift take hold
	4. Gene flow stopped, no hybrids, etc.
	- Much evidence backing up allopatric speciation
	- **EXAMPLES, YAY!**
		- Fish in seperate ponds, some with predators, some without, Fish with got faster at escaping, better at surviving
		- Flies from same jar put into jar with starch and jar with other nutrients, flies with starch got better at eating starch.  Put back in same jar, starch flies more likely to mate with starch flies, vice versa
		- As control, starch flies from 2 diff jars of starch all equally likely to mate 
		- Shrimp studied on atlantic vs pacific side of panama, evidence that they speciated
- **Sympatric** (Same Country) **Speciation**
	- Speciation in non-seperated area
	- **Polyploidy**(Cell division accident creates extra chromosomes)
		- Occasionally in animals, Very frequent in plants
		- Polyploid mates with other polyploid/ pollinates self, creates fertile offspring
		- *OTHER FORM* -- 2 SPECIES INTERBREED
			- Infertile hybrid can self reproduce
			- Infertile hybrid can eventually become fertile(becomes allopolyploid)
			- **Allopolyploid** - Fertile with others of same, infertile with parent species(created new species)
		- Many crops are polyploids(oats, cotton, potatoes, tobacco, wheat)
	- **Sexual selection**
		- Some females prefer different male features, only breed with those features
		- Gene pools kept seperate bc features inheritable, no reason to interbreed
	- **Habitat Differentation**
		- Part of population exploits resource not used by all others, results in habitat isolation
		- Natural selection reinforces habitat choices as some adapt to be better at using habitat
***
## Key concept **24.2**:Speciation can take place with or without geographic separation
***
## **24.3** Hybrid Zones
 - Zones where hybrid species are encouraged to form at incomplete reproductive boundaries
 - Hybrid zones in lines
	 - Toad species prefer different elevations, 'Goldilocks Zone' that forms a line where their prefered elevations intersect
	 - Can spread more into population, if hybrid organisim joins either of the parent species and breeds
	 - In the case of the toads, hybrids die more, less likely to reproduce
 - Hybrid zones and environmental change
	 - Climate change expandes/contracts places where species live
	 - Hybrid zone created/destroyed bc of overlap
	 - EG: Birds and flying squirells
 - Hybrid zones over time
	 - Sometimes form distinct hybrid species(Galapagos birds make new 'Big Bird')
	 - Don't distinguish from parents
		 - **Reinforcement**(strengthen reproductive barriers) -- hybrids less fit
			 - Hybrids less fit, natural selection reinforces prezygotic reproductive barriers
			 - Stronger reproductive barriers
		 - **Fusion**(weaken reproductive barriers(species fuse)) -- reproductive barriers too small
			 - Barriers to reproduction too week, enough gene flow occurs to bring species together
			 - Speciation reverses
		 - **Stability**(Nothing changes, hybrids just coexist) -- hybrids more fit
			 - Hybrids more fit than parents, hybrids thrive at times
			 - A few examples where hybrids selected against and still stable
			 - Natural selection cannot force species to breed, create new species

## Key concept **24.3**: Hybrid zones reveal factors that cause reproductive isolation
***
##**24.4** Speciation speed, reach
 - Speciation time studied from fossils
	 - **Puncuated model** - New species change suddenly when they branch off from parents
	 - **Gradual model** - Species diverge slowly
	 - Hard to tell a difference between the two in fossils, but both have been observed
	 - Hard to tell speciation bc reproductive isolation not fossilized
 - Speciation Rates
	 - Rapid process after start
	 - Can be kickstarted by creation of hybrid species
	 - Time between speciation events: varies a lot, on average 6.5 million years
	 - Life takes a long time to recover after extinction events
 - Genetics of speciation
	 - 'How many genes influence the creation of a new species'
	 - Single genes can alter functionality enough to cause isolation(flipped genitalia in snails)
	 - Other organisims, more genes needed

Key Concept **24.4**: Speciation can occur rapidly or slowly and can result from changes in few or many genes
