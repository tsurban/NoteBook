### Alternatives to chemical evolution/single spontaneousgeneration
some of these have some evidence
**Exobiology** 
 - Panspermia - living microorganism surfed to this planet on waves in space
	 - Space inhospitible, cold
	 - probably nothing could have surfed, stayed alive
 - Directed Panspermia - Organisim encased in rock, was a meteorite, struck earth, organisim released
	 - Evidence for: researcher found meteorite in afr. with fossilized cyanobacteria in it
	 - Evidence against: --- not likely
 - Picnic hypothesis -- life came forth bc intergalactic travelers came here, left garbage here
	 - peru/andes mountains have some roads that look like runways
 - Zoo Hypothesis - Life deliberately planted at cellular level, evolution has been watched by expirementer
	 - hard to say expirementer could conceal self from us
 - Equation for life - tried to prove that life could exist on other planets:
	 - N is Number of planets
	 - R is rate at which stars made 
	 - Fp number of stars with planets is , 
	 - Ne is number planets
	 - F is number planets with environment for life(1)
	 - Fl is number of planets that have potential for life that HAVE life
	 - Fi is Fl that have intellegent life
	 - Fc is number of intellegent life forms with civilization
	 - L is mean lifespan of the civilizations

$$N=Rf_pN_ef_lf_if_cL$$
### Real stuff
 - Darwinian evolution
	 - Descent with modification(offspring different from parents)
	 - Modification due to changes in genetic code(darwin knew nothing about genetics) that allow for organisim to adapt better to local environment
	 - Over time, new organisims/species appear because they cant reproduce with other species
	 - many ppl at the time didnt believe evolution's need for so much time
	 1.Overproduction
		- all orgnaisims produce more than can survive up to primates
		- oak trees produce large # offspring, very few acorns sprout bc predators, competition for resources, 10-15 years later, produce more seeds
		- Sea turtles -- hundreds of eggs at a time 1 reaches adulthood(predators, disease, etc.)
	 2.Competition
		 - 
	 3.Survival of the Fittest
		 - Fittest may not be best genetically designed, just has to reproduce successfully
	 4.Reproduction
		 - is good
	 5.Speciation
		 - speciation event = natural desaster, etc where environment altered so that completley different group is fit
		 - eventually, specie cant reproduce with other species, complete seperation of groups
	 - Influence things to natural selection
		 - Competition
		 - Carrying Capacity
			 - How many members of a population an environment can hold with its resources
			 - Carrying capacity higher for population than for overall ecosystem usually
		 - Fitness-genetic contribution to future generations(measured on species level)
			 - Absolute-Expressed as # of offspring produced by specific genotype; is a number = how many of certian genotype is next generation
			 - Relative-relative abiity of a genotype to be represented in the next generation = more common, not measured
	 - Properties of fitness
		 - Properties of genotype
		 - Genotypes that match environment are more successful
		 - Genotypes measured for more than one generation
			 - Previously, we could only detremine one generation's Phenotype
			 - Now we can just extract DNA 
			 - Genetic info must go onto next generation
	 - Lethal mutations 
		 - usually just affect one individual in eukaryotes
		 - prokaryotes, one lethal mutation can affect entire population
		 - what happens if in sex chromosome
			 - Sex chromosome dimporhic(unmatched pair)w
			 - Usually the male dies
			 - Polymorphism, asexual reproduction must occur
  - Hardy-Weinberg
	  - p+q=1
	  - p is allele frequency for dominant allele
	  - $$p^2+2pq+q^2$$ 
	  - p^2 is allele frequency if homozyagous dom
	  - 2pq is allele frequenty if heterozygous dom
	  - q^2 is allele frequency if homozygous rec
 - Population Genetics
	 - Gene Frequency
		 - Frequencie of Homo. Dom, Het, Homo Rec.
	 - Allele Frequency
		 - Frequency of an allele in a population
	 - Gene Flow(per unit time)
		 - Immigration+Emigration: The moving of ppl changes the gene frequencies bc they take their genes with them
		 - Movement of organisims between populations causes allele frequencies to change over time
	 - Genetic Drift(per unit time)
		 - Some random change in the frequencies in a population(group of interbreeding individuals)
			 - New members by birth or imigration
			 - lose members by death or emigration
		 - Hard to know for total human population
			 - A deem is a subset of the total population
			 - Statistically, seek to use deems as a sample to represent the whole population
			 - Problem bc deem may be diff from population
			 - Within deem, you have evolutionary unit(reproductively avalible organisims(not too young or old))
			 - Gene pool is sum total of genes in a population(reproductively avalible organisims)
	 - Variations
		 - Continous
			 - Height(everyone is near eachother in terms of height)
		 - Discontinous
			 - Weight(Weight is more controlled by environment)
Forward and backwards mutations
 - Forward = away from wild type
 - Backward = toward wild type
	 - Hardy-Weinberg Law of Equilibrium
		 - Hardy and Winberg were independent researchers, seperately published papers on same thing
			 - Said that gene frequency of a population will not change significantly without environmental factor
		 - Conditions must be met
			 - Reproduction Random
			 - No net mutations(forward mutations=backwards mutations)
			 - Large(statistically powerful) interbreedong population
			 - No immigration or emigration
			 - No natural selection(gene frequency will not change without some natural selection)
 - Population Genetics
	 - Need to know Effective Breeding Size $N_e$
	 - In $N_e$ goes to zero, extinction
	 - Population Geneticits determine if species viable
		 - California condor(50 individuals at one point)
		 - $N_e$ = 50, population not viable
		 - $N_e ->$ 0, species go into extinction
		 - Humans making many species going to extinction, not a natural process
	 - If decent size population, can measure genetic drift
		 - Measured by $F_st = H_t - H_s / H_t$
		 - Where $H_t$ is the measurement of heterzygosity by random mating in the total population
		 - and $H_s$ is the heterygosity of the subpopulation
	 - Model Gene Flow(dont write down)
		 - HERITABILITY OF AALLELES
		 - $h^2 = V_a/V_p$
	 - Inbreeding co-efficent
		 - Organisim becomes more and more homozygous dom or rec
		 - $F$ is the probability that the alleles are identical by descent
		 - This relates to the heritability issue
		 - $F=(H_o - H)/H_o$
		 - $H_o = 2pq$
		 - H = homozygous(p^2 or q^2)
			 - The alleles can be
			 - Allozygous- homozygous bc random mating
			 - Autozygous- homozygous due to inbreeding
 - Population GENETICS CONT.
	 - Populations shift in genotypic frequencies
	 - Darwin says that any change in environment change 'allele frequencies'
	 - Selection by specific genotypes(not phenotypes)
		 - Stabilizing selection
			 - select individuals with heterzygote genotype
			 - heterozygote advantage
			 - why?: heterozygotes have both dom and rec allele, allows to be a generalist/have more flexibility
			 - Then, when have selective pressure, directional selection happens easier
			 - Genetic drift where heterozygotes are favored
		 - Directional selection
			 - happens after application of selective pressure placed
			 - mean shifts toward tail of curve
			 - Genetic drift where one homozygote is favored
		 - Distuptive selection
			 - takes away heterzygotes advantage
			 - bimodal curve
			 - eventually, you get 2 new species(if distuptive event continues)
			 - Genetic drift where heterozygotes not favored(both homo favored)
		 - random vs aggregated vs hyperdispersed 
			 - random and aggregated best for hardy weinberg 
			 - hyperdispersed bad for hardy weinberg...not sure why
		 - Sexual selection
			 - mate selection incredibly complex
			 - some plants and amphibians can switch sex
			 - if too much testosterone in water, male frogs switch to female
			 - Darwin saw males had significant adaptations to better sexual selection
			 - so felales must choose one male form the rest
			 - Males can reproduce many times but females limited
			 - by choosing only onemale females place a pressure on these charactistics
			 - brightly colored males also attract predators, distract from eggs
			 - move to equal xx and xy genotypes
			 - Competition
			 - intra-sexual(male vs male ritualistic behavior(bighorn sheep))
			 - intersexual(female compete for male)
		 - Kin selection
			 - Idea that behavior can impct the genetics of family or fam. group
			 - average fraction og genes shared by relatives
			 - parent/child .5
			 - half siblings .25
			 - Grandparent/grandchild .25
			 - first cousins .125
			 - altruism > enhanced fitness of a population as the expense of individual
			 - changed now because now altruistic because people popularly talk about not in family
			 - allows the family unit to survive and reproduce
			 - always somebody watching out for predators(closest kin relatioship to family group(parent closest to all kids)
			 - Allows fitter children ability to produce
			 - if increase fitness of the family(k is ratio of increased fitness, r is .5/.25) K>1/r
	 - Examples of natural selection
		 - Batesian Mimicry
			 - aposematic coloration
			 - insects copy other insects based on coloration(poison dart frogs, depending on what they eat/viceroys and monarchs)
		 - Mullerian Mimicry
			 - mimic patterns(butterlflies, tropical prayng mantis like leaves)
			 - mimic surroundings, or eachother, whatever
		 - Emsleyan Mimicry
			 - Dangerous snake mimics less dangerous one
