	 - Protsters killed by police, marks high point in student movement
	 - Spread beyond elite colleges
 - Troop morale in vietnam plummeted
	 - Troops were mostly poor + minorities
	 - Social changes domestically were also happening with troops(drugs, peace/black power)
	 - Thousands desert
	 - Lack of discipline convinces officers that US must leave vietnam
 - Vietnam vets hold antiwar demonstrations
 - Public support waning
	 - NYT reports on *My Lai* massacre 1968, american troops kill 350 SOUTH viet. CITIZENS
	 - NYT pentagon papers(DODefense report) tracing involvement and how presidents had mislead the people
		 - Court denied gov request to stop publication
		 - 1973 war powers act, required president to get congressional approval for commitment of american troops overseas

### The End of the Vietnam War
 - 1973 nixon negotiated vietnam settlement(paris peace agreement)"peace with honor"
	 - Left in place south vietnam gov and left north vietnamese+viet cong soldiers in parts of the south
	 - American bombing stopped, draft ended
	 - Did not solve issue of if vietnam was one country or two
	 - North vietnam overrun south in 1975, all US did was rescue americans from embassy
 - Only war US has ever lost
	 - 58k Americans Killed, 3-4mil japanese
	 - Cost hundreds of millions of dollars better used domestically
	 - Undermined American trust in the system, made americans reluctant to send army overseas(Vietnam syndrome)
 - 20 yrs later, SecDef published memoir saying war was terribly wrong, ignored history and culture and either/or communsim policy
	 - NYT rejected apology, deaths of men could not be so easily wished away
