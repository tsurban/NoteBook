## APUSH PD3 Definining Economic Freedom
***
### Toward Free Labor
 - Slavery was one of many unfree labor
 - Rapid decline of indentured servitude and apprentenceship
 - Increase of paid domestic service
 - Wage workers became more avalable(indentured servants get out)
 - Servants and apprentices took advantage of rev to escape
	 - Apprentenceship and servitude seen as unfree, escape common(shows fundamental diff btw slavery)
	 - By 1800, indentured servitude mostly gone

### The Soul of a Republic
 - Americans preoccupied with social freedom
	 - Debates between level of freedom
	 - Include land?/Include self-employment?
	 - Even conservative John adams thinks land good idea
	 - Radicals think gov should limit, redistribute property
	 - Most ppl think freedom means equal opportunity
 - TJ thinks Economic resources barrier to freedom
	 - abolished entail(passing of inheritance to specified fam members)
	 - Abolished primogeniture(land goes entirely to eldest son)
	 - Help prevent future aristocracey
	 - Proposed giving 50 acres to every person of full age

### Politics of Inflation(think RTX 3080)
 - Debate over authorites should try to boost econ independence
	 - Should price increases be limited?
	 - Inflation created bc print money, goods hoarded
 - 1776-1779, many crowds confronted hoarding merchants
	 - Often, stocks seized, sold at just price

### The Debate over Free Trade
 - States encouraged to set limits by congress
 - Elites were living the good life
 - When limits set, major backlash from "free market" merchants
	 - Free market means that demand dictates cost(Adam Smith *The wealth of nations*)
	 - Demand artifically high, cost high
 - 1799, free market won out, states stop making limiting laws
