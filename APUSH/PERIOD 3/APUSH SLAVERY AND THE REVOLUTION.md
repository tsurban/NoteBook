## APUSH PD3 slavery and the Revolution
***
### Natives vs AA expirence
 - AA saw rev as opportunity to get freedom
 - Slave trade normal part of life
 - Contradictory with liberty

### The Language of Slavery and Freedom
 - Slavery contrasted to Liberty in rev
 - Slavery mostly political category/not real condition of living
 - Used as shorthand for those without a vote
 - Few ppl equate the two real slavery+figurative(James Otis does)
 - Even slave owners saw selves as formerly enslaved 
 - Odd

### Obstacles to Abolition
 - Freedom and slavery contrast seems so apparent today
 - Slavery already engrained in america
	 - Founding fathers almost all owned slaves
	 - John adams and Thomas Paine didnt
 - Some argued white freedom built on slavery
	 - Slaves offered economic autonomy
	 - 1780 Vir law gave Rev War vets 300 acres and a slave
 - Based on Lockean vision of contract
	 - Government seizing of slaves violates contract
	 - If slave owners dont consent, then Owners become slaves to gov

### The Cause of General Liberty
 - By est. natural liberty, calls questions abt slavery
 - Before revolution, little talk of slavery wrongness
	 - 1688 German quakers declared slavery unjust
	 - Samuel Sewall 1700 book "all sons of adam have equal right unto liberty"
	 - Antislavery stpread to quakers
 - Revolution brought antislavery into common discourse
	 - Some thought slavery would eventually bring national punishment
	 - Private TJ condem slavery as worse than figuartive slavery

### Petitions for freedom
 - Slaves saw freedom as right as weapon against bondage
 - Called out hypocracy
 - Freedom petitions(first steps to emancipation)
	 - Arguments for liberty in NE corts
	 - Freedom thoughts increase escape attempts
 - Lemuel Haynes argue amer extend freedom to slaves 1776
	 - Sought to push definition of real slavery over political slavery
 - Evidence of AA intelegence in arguments made
 - Many slaves only 1-2 gens removed, ancestors free
 - By invoking american ideas, demonstrate americanization

### British Emancipators
 - 5k slaves fought for america, freed
 - Many more freed by brits
	 - dunmore 1775
	 - Phillipsburg Proglamation Gen. Henry Clinton(similar thing)
	 - Thirty of TJ slaves ran to brits(similar for others)
	 - SC lose 25%, GEO lose 33.33%

	 - 15k leave with british
		 - Went to Nova Scotia, ENgland, Sierra Leone(Specifically for former US slaves)
		 - Some reenslaved in west indies
	 - Britan eventually paid for slaves freed

### Voluntary Emancipations
 - During AmerRev, importing slaves discuraged
 - South in shambles after war
 - Many owners emancipate slaves
 - In SC and GEO, No abolition whatsoever

### Abolition in the North
 - 1777-1804, all states north MD start to emancipate
 - Most laws free children of slaves when reach adulthood bc slaves still property
 - Indentured servitude increase among blacks
 - Very slow process
 - Very little voluntary emancipation

### Free Black Communities
