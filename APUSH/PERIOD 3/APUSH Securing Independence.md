## APUSH PD3 Winning Independence(after declaration)
***
### The Balance of Power
 - Declaring Independence !== Winning Independence
 - Seemed heavily weighted favoring britan
	 - Most powerful Navy
	 - Hessian recruits
	 - Well trained army
	 - Americans have only local militias and poor continental army
	 - Washington knows this
 - Other side
	 - Many americans fought in 7 years war or trained in 1770s
	 - More devoted, home turf, own freedom
	 - 1 in 20 free white males died in war
	 - Army fighting held up idea of freedom
 - Some dobut in london if worth cost
 - Serious mistakes
	 - Thought less support for indepent
	 - Americans howed more spirit/resilleance
	 - France would benefit from british loss(hint hint)

### Role of blacks in the revolution
 - Unprecedented opportunity fro freedom
	 - fighting in either army
	 - Washington refused to accept black soldiers
	 - After dunmore 1775 proclamation(blacks free if join brits), changed mind
	 - 5k blacks enlist in militias in Cont. Army
	 - Slaves would go in place of owner or owner son for draft
	 - R.I. formed black regiment, freed slaves 
	 - Most slaves fought in integrated groups(white officers)
	 - Southern colonies do same, not SC+Geo
	 - 800 slaves take uo dunmore
	 - Other slaves guide royal army, spy for it, do houskeeping work for it
