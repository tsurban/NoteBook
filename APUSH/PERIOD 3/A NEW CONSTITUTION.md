 - Most born into moey, status
 - ~1/2 owned slaves

 - in private to ensure debate

### The structure of government
 - Agreed on many parts
	 - Legislative, executive, judicial branch
	 - States forbidden from infringing on private property
	 - Government represent people
	 - Seek compromise btw monarchy & anarchy
	 - Articles of Confederation too democratic
 - Hamilton proposes life senate and prez terms(no support)
 - Differences over balance btw feds and state govs
	 - Madison's virginia plan(2 house congress system where state population determines representation)

	 - In the end, 2 houses, 1 by population, 1 by statehood

### The Limits of Democracy
 - Under articles, no offical chosen by popular vote
 - Chosing house by vote is big expansion
 - Intentionally not completley democratic
	 - Gov isolated from sudden mvmnts
	 - Commoners chose from elites
	 - Initally house only 65 members
	 - No direct election of federal judges or president
		 - President chosen by electoral college or House
		 - # electors in state = #senate reps+#House reps

		 - Senate elect VP
 - Reflection on distrust of voters to make good choice
