## APUSH notes Contextualizing the Depression
***
### American system
 - Lots of parts
 - Bank
	 - Big national bank
	 - Controls state banks
 - Movement of people and goods/Infrastructure
	 - Canals, RR
 - Brainchild of Henry clay, adopted by quincy adams
 - South didnt like bc tariffs to pay for system in the north and they liked their current system
 - Helps US become econ. independent
	 - Strong/healthy
	 - Participate in the world economy
 - Diverse parts
 - Enormus criticizm of both systems
 - More abt creating something(new deal is abt fixing things)

### Growth
 - Growth after WWI, Grwoth for industrialization
 - Growth Expanded opportunity
	 - New urban, industral
	 - Farmers
		 - Hardship
		 - Commercial farming enabled industrial revolution(ppl can leave farms)
		 - Farm prices(supply+demand, environmental factors, how much of commodity is on market)
		 - Americans love possibility(cotton), creates oversaturation, falls in price, etc
			 - Happening in interwar period
			 - Europe cannot feed itself(devistated by war)
			 - America increases production, farmers profit
			 - When europe rebounds, prices fall, they SHOULD produce less, they DO produce more
			 - Credit issues more present in farmers bc need machinery
			 - Environmental toll(dustbowl)
 - Econ. Instability led to new efforts to reform US society+econ

### Responses
 - hoover response vs FDR response
 - Stock market didnt by itself cause the great depression
	 - Weak US economy
	 - Expansion of economy
	 - Overextension of credit
	 - Global markets
	 - Lack of regulation
	 - Speculation
	 - When one industry fell, all tied together
 - Hoover responded but was ineffective bc didnt think fedgov could expand
	 - Role of fedgov has been expanding since lincoln
 - Depression transformed aerican life
	 - Fedgov responsible for regulating ecnomy, modernizing infrastructure, uplifting citizens by guaranteeing economic security
	 - Makes fedgov responsible for the PEOPLE, not just the business(lincoln)
 - Freedom meaning expanded still very exclusive
	 - Economic security for more bc of new deal policies
	 - Excludes women, blacks, nativeamericans(some programs for natives if willing to give up culture)
 - New Deal improved econ. conditions but didnt generate sustained prosperity
 - FDR was gov of NY(Basically microcausm of US)
 - Hoover viewed depression as inevitible part of cycle
 - FDR viewed as emergency, not a cycle
 - Hoover views liberalism as free biz
 - FDR redefines liberalism as activist fedgov
 - Hoover gives money to states to use
 - FDR adds money directly to ppl
 - Three Rs(Relief, Recovery, Reform)
	 - Recovery+Relief to be temporary
	 - Recovery to stabilize econ(NIRA, AA)
	 - Relief to do immediate and temporary relief(Emergency bak act, CCC, TVA, WPA)(shames from needing help)
	 - Reform aims to never have depression happen again(regulation)(FDIC, Glass-Steagle, SEC, Social Security Administration(supposed to be temporary, supplemental))
	 - Some aspects contradict american identity, hard to accept(AA takes commodities off market)
		 - Reduces amount of commodity in circulation by destroying commodity
		 - Antithetical to american identity
		 - Starving ppl
