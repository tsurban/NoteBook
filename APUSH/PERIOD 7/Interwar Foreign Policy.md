## APUSH notes American Interwar Foreign policy(1920-1941)
***
 - Foreign policy is super nuances
	 - Makes decisions that are in its own best interest
	 - Will collaborate with other nations when it suits american needs
	 - Will not engage in long term/binding cooperation
	 - Isolationism
		 - Isolated from collective agreements
		 - Not complete isolationsim
 - Why good neighbor
	 - GW adress - - Munroe doctorine - roosevelt corolarry - Dollar/Moral Diplomacy - Quarantine(good neighbor)
	 - Western hemisphere respect socerignty, not interventionism
	 - Mutually beneficial even w/ undemocratic govs
		 - US not a bully
		 - El salvador+Nicagura(not dem)(change from wilson, only time in american history)
	 - Focus on Great depression recovery
	 - Unified response to axis agression
		 - Build goodwill now, will have future goodwill response
		 - Roosevelt has international approach to great depression
			 - Already thinking in 1933 abt responding to japan and germany
			 - Build goodwill to use friendly nations to do things
	 - Nationalistic - AM interists are diff, superior
		 - International trade, econ strength
	 - Unilateral action, bilateral agreements
		 - Engages on a case-by-case basis when needs suited
		 - Makes agreements with other nations
	 - Use neutrality to stay out of war
		 - Neutrality acts of 1935, 1936, 1937
		 - Not involved in the fighting, but find other ways(political/economic)
		 - Manifested by good neighbor policy
		 - Apply equally to all beligerants/conflictors
			 - Beligarents not looked at in terms of right/wrong side, just beligarants or not
			 - Who classifies? - prez/executive branch
			 - Nation can be at war without being declared at war by prez
			 - This power of FDR seems dictitorial
		 - Once prez declares beligerant, US cannot engage w/ you
			 - Italy and etheopia both beligerants
			 - Cannot aid either, despite italy being the agressor and us self-interests want etheopia free
			 - Spain civil war, FDR declares beligerant, cannot support even non-facist side
			 - Increases activation energy needed to convince americans of need to go to war(pearl harbor has to happen)
			 - Lets agressor feel uncountered
			 - Lend-lease and cash/carry(really hard for america to help england)
			 - Switching from peactime economy to wartime economy is harder(does really good with switching the economy)
		 - WWII sold as defensive war bc pearl harbor
		 - 
 - Washington naval arms conference
	 - Tensions are in seasia are on the rise
	 - Meant to releive the tensions
	 - US unilaterally initates conference, needs bilateral agreements w/ other nations
	 - Basically what LON was supposed to do, us willing to engage in LON stuff, but not on others terms
	 - Cherrypicks nations w/ common interests w/ usa and also japan
		 - Occupiers of seasian countries(colonial powers come, not actual places)
	 - Agree to three things
		 - Each nation maintatins rationfor navy/limiting military strength
		 - Agree to respect territorial integrity/china(makes european nations worried abt colonies in se asia and invasion)
		 - Continue to respect open door policy of china
	 - Why important
		 - Where ppl think this is going
		 - No actual enforcement taken
		 - Worried abt safety of colonies and disruption of trade
			 - Japan needs natural resources, dependent on us for oil, us cutting off supply
			 - Japan believed in ethnic superiority(their right to expand/occupy/destroy)
 - Neutrality acts box president in, how to support GB w/ neutrality acts still in place
	 - Cash-carry(pay cash, move on own boats)
	 - Lend-lease(lend, lease on island, get it if not returned)
 - Hitler comes to power in 1933 w/ fire in capitol
	 - Creates narrative placing blame on opponent, elevates himself
	 - Uses influence to manipulate parliment to make himself chancelor and then makes himself furher
	 - Premise is 'I can restore germany to preWWI greatness' by...
		 - Reuniteing all germans into one country

			 - Rhineland(fr)/sars/sudatenland(czech)
			 - These are the areas where versailles said dont occupi
			 - Also have lotsa natural resources

		 - Battle of britan
			 - Mostly air battle
			 - Muflafla(german air force)
			 - attacks military instillations, bombs london
	 - Italy and germany ally, invade northafrica

	 - Focus of war is on europe, win europe, then win asia
	 - frustrating stratagey for russia and for US in pacific(many losses)
	 - strong belief that europe dosent belong in controlling asia
	 - Japanese front is really a whole-nation movement

	 - Then shift focus to asia strategy(island hopping)(turningpoint is battle of midway, then go from island to island to counter)
