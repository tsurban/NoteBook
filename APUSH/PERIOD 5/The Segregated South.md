### The Failure of the New South Dream
 - Promise of New South unfuffilled
 - The rich(planters, merchants, industrialists) prospered, the region as a whole declined
 - Appalacian mining and Carolina+Georgia textile production, Furniture+cigartte manufacturing common
 - Reasons for investing were cheap prison labor
 - Except for iron/steel producing Birmingham Alabama, most cities were export centers for southern crops

### Black Life in the South

		 - Allowed for growth of black middle class
		 - Blakc men excluded from supervisory positions

### The Kansas Exodus
 - South was mostly poor with some rich people

 - Kansas portrayed as idyllic land by promoters of the Kansas Exodus(leaving for kansas)
	 - Most blacks didnt have enough capital to start farming, took unskilled labor jobs
	 - Few returned to the south(felt significantly more free)
 - Job opportunties expanded in northern cities
	 - Refused to give jobs to blacks over white migrants from europe

### The Transformation of Black Politics
 - Both black officeholding and voting contunued for a bit after 1877, but democrats regained control thru jerryandering

	 - Black women who werent providing for the family took over black politics
	 - National Assoiatiation of Colored Women
		 - Fought for women rights and racial uplift
		 - Most members came from small middle class
		 - Preached respictablility, degraded idea that all blacks were second class/uncivilized

### The Emergence of Booker T. Washington

### The Elimination of Black Voting
 - Blacks continued to cast ballots for 30 years after reconstruction despite fraud and violence
 - Democrats afratid of biracial government
 - Every southern state enacted laws restricting black vote btw 1890+1906

		 - (1/8 black) plessy tried to sit in a white traincar
		 - Allowed as long as seperate but equal

### Segregation and White Domination
 - States took Plessy v furgeson as go-ahead for segregation legislation
	 - Segregation was part of self-reinforcign system btw economic status, inferior education, disenfranchisement
	 - Ensures whites always have the upper hand
	 - Social etiquette evolved so blacks were submissive to whites
	 - Mississippi, Chinese schools establishe, Mexicans barred forom many restaruants, etc despite being "white"
