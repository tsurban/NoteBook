 - Rising school taces+RR taxes also opposed by many
 - Poor white supporters of republicans turned against it bc not helping them economically
 - White southerners couldnt accept former slaves voting, holding office, being equal
 - Anti-Reconstruction campaign of violence challenged new southern govs and federal policymakers

### Reign of Terror
 - At first, violence was disorganized, local
 - Violence vs reopublican govs far more widespread, fear-inducing
	 - Secret societies established to prevent blacks from voting, destroying republican party by assassinating leaders, public officals
	 - Ku Klux Klan was most famous

		 - Led by planters, merchants, democrat politicans(thought of selves as "respectable citizens")
		 - launched reign of terror against republican leaders

			 - Moreso targeted AA who broke the norm by getting land or were in politics
			 - Sometimes did insurrections
		 - Southern govs unable to supress the klan, needed federal help 
			 - Three enforcement acts outlawed terrorist societies and allowed president to counter them with army
			 - Continued expansion of federal power
			 - Grant dispatched marshals and troops to arrest many klansmen
			 - Many left south
			 - Klan died out after highly publicized trials
