## APUSH PD5(6) Freedom in the Gilded age
***
### Gilded Age
 - Covered in a layer of gold
 - Massive economic expansion
 - Massive corruption and opressive treatment
 - “Get rich, dishonestly if we can, honestly if we must”

### The Social Problem
 - Americans struggled to make sense of new social order
 - Debate over political economy reached into public sphere
 - Better classes/respectable classes/dangeros classes
 - Bitter strife to make money became the norm
 - Frequent investivations by states of relations btw labor and captiol, showed distrust btw employer and employee

### Freedom, Inequality, Democracy
- New wage class on the edge of poverty redefines freedom
- Old world curse of division of society into classes came to new world
- Became harder to see wage labor as path to full freedom
- Many viewed concentration of wealth as natural
	- Wages determined by supply and demand
	- Wealth flows based on economic biz sense and access to money
- Link between freedom and equality decreasing
- Social science devised ways of making liberty equals good with inequality in distribution
	- Thought by "liberal performers"
	- Broek with the republican party, changed northern view on reconstruction
	- Feared that lower-class using gov to advance self was abuse of democracy, threat to individual liberty and property rights
	- Some believed democracy should be limited to property owners again

### Social Darwinism in America
 - Natural superiority of some over others invoked before civil war to justify slavery
 - Darwin's origin of species was oversimplified to apply to social problems
 - Social darwanism is evolution as a natural process in human society
	 - Depressions of 1870&90s didnt convince that poor ppl werent responsible for own fate
	 - Charity workers+Govs distinguished 'deserving' poor from 'undeserving'
	 - Failure to advance in society thught of as lack of character
	 - Most influential social darwinist was yale professer william graham sumner
		 - Defined freedom with acquiring, enjoying, disposing of property as he choses
		 - Means that freedom requires acceptance of inequality
		 - Thought that no social classes owed anything to others

### Liberty of Contract
 - biz and professional classes embrace idea of negative freedom with limited gov and completely free market
	 - Laws of contract are the foundation of civilization
	 - As long as labor was governed by freely arrived at contracts, neither gov or unions could interfere with conditions
	 - This was response to workers wanting 8-hour day, unemploument relief
	 - ^^ would be threat to liberty
	 - Free labor became defense of unrestrained capitalist operations

### The Courts and Freedom
 - Courts played big role in bringing liberty of contract into mainstream liberty ideas
	 - 1880s, 14th amendment came to mean liberty of contract, not equality for slaves
	 - Struck down state laws regulating econ enterprise
	 - Laws w/max work hours and safe conditions as insult to free labor
	 - viewed state biz regulation as insult to free labor
		 - SC at first willing to accept public interest regulations(munn v illinois w/state reg of grain storage prices)
		 - Reversed 9 years later w/wabash v illinois, fedgov only can regulate interstate RR
		 - SC consistently ruled in favor of RR companies
	 - Biz complain of loss of economic freedom
	 - NY court of appeals invalidate state law prohibiting cigar manufacturing in tenements
	 - Women understood to have same idea of 'liberty'
	 - US v EC Knight Co ruled sherman antitrust couldnt break up sugar refining monopoly
	 - SC in Lochner v NY void state law est 10hr day or 60hr week maximum
	 - SC strikes down laws empowering unions
