DRED SCOTT/CAUSES OF CESSESION IN-CLASS NOTES

# 1/6/2021 Theo Urban
## APUSH PD5 UNION IN PERIL	
***
### Existing tension increases
 - Westward Expansion
 - Market Revolution/Industrialization
 - Movement to polarized two party system
 - These factors increase until secession

### Popular Soverignty + Kansas-Nebraska act
 - Steven Douglas is the biggest proponent of popsov (synonomous)
 - popsov pretty inconsistent with intentions of the framers of the constitution
	 - framers afraid of the people
	 - framers have many safety valves between people that elite can control
	 - Despite this, huge appeal to the average citizen
 - Made developing the west his priority
	 - Sees economic potential for illinois+personal moneys
	 - Knows you need a train to the west to integrate west(thru illinois)
	 - To get the RR, Government needs to exist in these territories(become states)
	 - Knows the south would not admit free states to the union
	 - Solution is to push popsov in place of missouri compromise(gives southerners the idea that they have equal stake)
 - Kansas Nebraska Act
	 - Divide territory of nebraska into 2(kansas+nebraska)
	 - Repeal Missouri compromise + Replace with popsov
	 - Douglas thinks is this is a good plan bc most ppl in kansas are farmers from the free midwest(antislave)
 - Consequences of Kansas-Nebraska Act
	 - New political parties
	 - Attempts to influence kansas
		 - Missouri ppl move into kansas
		 - Aid societies in the northeast give money to ppl in the northeast to move to kansas
	 - Tensions High
	 - "Bleeding Kansas"
		 - PPL from missouri cross border just to vote
		 - THIS is the fear of the framers

### Republican Party
 - Organized in wisconsin, 1854(shift of political power west(previously parties organized in NE))
 - Economic Changes
	 - Economy integrated in the northeast direction
	 - The only way for western farmers to get crops into north was by steamboats, now can use RR
	 - RR travels to the NorthEast
 - Midwest aligns more with old northwest
 - 2 big centers of industrial stuff
	 - Eastern Seaboard(Boston, Philly, Baltimore)
	 - Great Lakes(chicago)
	 - Produce Farming equipment and trade for foreigneastern luxry goods
 - The west gives the east raw goods+ores
 - Social change
 - Massive european immiggration
	 - Ireland+German State
 - Republican Party has free labor mindset
	 - Goal is to stop spread of slavery, not end it(not abolition)
 - Supported by moderate democrats who dont like democrat slavery + free soilers + knownothing(antiimmigrant party) + Whigs(collapsed bc disorganization)

### Dred Scott
 - Chief Justice Roger Taney (Jackson appointee from Bank War) (southerner/strict constructionist)
 - Three questions
	 - Could a black person be a citizen + sue in court?
		 - White person could be citizen because
			 - Framers didnt intend AA to be citizens
			 - Citizen meant free from legal discrimination+full constitytional protections
	 - Did residence in a free state make you free
		 - No, once youve left
	 - Did congress possess the power to prohibit slavery in a territory?
		 - NO
			 - Missouri compromise was unconstitutional
			 - Popsov questionable
			 - Sees as not a power given by the constitution, states cant decide bc need congressional approval needs constitutional approval, dosent exist
