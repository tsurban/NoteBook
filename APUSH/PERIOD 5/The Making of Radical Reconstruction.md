## APUSH PD5 Immediate Reconstruction
***
### Andrew Johnson
 - Grew up poor, found success in politics
 - 2 terms as tennessee gov
 - Against large planters, for "Honest Yeoman"
 - Only senator from confederate state to remain in DC
 - Intolerant of critizcizm+unwilling to compromise
 - States Rights
	 - Said that secession was illegal, south never left union, states had never lost right to govern own affairs
 - VERY RACIST, didnt see AA as having any role in Reconstruction

### The Failure of Presidential Reconstruction
 - Allowed all white southerners to be pardoned for oath of alliegence except for planters with farm > 20k calue
 - Most >20k got individual pardons
 - Johnson left most of it up to localities
 - Southern governments bautse this
 - Elected old confdererates, old elite

### The Black Codes
 - New southern Govs passed laws that granted some rights and placed protections for whites(no vote, serve on jurys, testify vs whites)
 - If you failed to sign yearly labor contracts, you could be arrested and hired to whites
 - Some said judges could make black kids work for former owners sans parental consent
 - Completely violated free labor

### The Radical Republicans
 - Radical republicans called for dissolution of corrupt southern government, establishment of new govs with black men guaranteed right to vote
 - RR Loved expanded wartime federal power
 - Prominent ppl are charles sumner, thaddeus stevens
 - Thought that same fedgov civil war power must destroy racial inequality
 - Thaddeus Stevens sought to confiscate disloyal planters land and distribute it to former slaves and whites moving south
	 - TOO radical to gain widespread support

### The Origins of Civil Rights
 - South was underrepresented, Republicans had overwhelming majority in congress
 - Republicans divided btw moderates and radicals
 - Moderates
		 - Wanted to work with johnson to fix pkan
		 - Worried that no whites would accept black suffrage
	 - Both refused to allow elected southerners into congress
	 - Moderates left johnson gov in place
 - 2 bills proposed to improve johnsons plan
	 - Extend Freedmen's Bureau for longer
	 - Civil rights Bill of 1866
		 - Defined all persons born in the US as citizens, defined rights independent of race
		 - Equality before the law(no black codes)
		 - Free labor values(cant deny contract making, lawsuiting, or protection of person+property)
		 - Tried to give meaning to the 13th Amendment
	 - Johnson Vetoed both bills bc would centralize power+didnt think blacks should have citizenship
	 - Failed by 1 vote to pverride veto on Freedmens bureau(did so later)
 - Congressional Reconstruction
	 - 14th Amendment
		 - principle of birthright citizenship except for Native Americans
		 - Fedgov had authority to protect rights
		 - Prohibited states from denying "privileges or immunities" of citizens or denying anybody equal protection of the laws(broad meaning gives congress power)
		 - Did not grante black suffrage, did say that if state denied men right to vote, would be less represented in congress
			 - South had to choose btw political power and african american votes
		 - by guarenteeing equality before the law, big change
		 - Highly polarizing

### The Reconstruction Act
 - 14th amendment became central to campaigns in 1866
	 - Johnson urged votes for ppl supporting his platform, said radicals trying to assassinate him, undermining his public support
	 - Republicans anti-johnson won big
 - Every southern state but Tennessee refused to ratify 14th Amendment
	 - ^+Johnsons actions pushed moderates to radical side
	 - Congress passed Reconstruction act over a veto, dividing south
	 - Start of radical reconstruction(end 1877)

### Impeachment and the Election of Grant
 - Congress Tenure of Office act barred president from removing certian cabinet members
 - Johnson thinks its ubconstitutional, fired radical secretary of war
 - House impeached, Senate missed conviction by 1 vote bc feared radical successor, damage to seperation of powers, etc.
 - Republicans nominated Grant to president, beat Horiatio Seymour
 - Republicans correlated dems with secession+treason(waving the bloody shirt)
 - Dems said Reconstruction was unconstitutional, black suffrage violated tradition, openly appealed to racism

### The Fifteenth Amendment
 - Grant wins by slim margin, congress adpots 15th amendment, prohibits federal and state governments from denying any citizen the right to vote bc race
 - Opposed by dems, ratified in 1870
 - Left door open to literacy tests, property, poll taxes, etc
 - Before this, only 8 NORTHERN states allowed AA right to vote

### The second founding
 - Demonstrate empowered national state+entire citizenry with equality before the law
 - New amendments demonstrate a shift from the constitution from fearing fedgov to relying on it to protect rights
 - Constitution became path for minorities to claim freedom and protection vs misconduct

### Boundaries of Freedom
 - Major shift bc previously, american democracy had meant white male american democracy
 - Racial inclusiveness shown by Burlingame Treaty reaffirming china's soverignty over spheres of influence
 - Many predjudiced vs immigrants(chinese mostly), Franklin douglas spoke out
 - Charles Sumner moved to strike "White" from naturalization requirements, western states objected bc asians

### The Rights of Women
 - Womens rights activists dissapointed by 13/14/15 amenemnets 
 - Elizabeth Cady Stanton, "transition like from slavery to freedom"
 - Femenist argument is stronger with the end of slavery
 - Complained of limited job opportunities, unequal pay, divorse laws, abortion

### Feminists and Radicals
 - Wyoming territory, womens rights expand(vote) bc want to attract women into male dominated area
 - 14th amendment was 1st time "male" was used in the constitution
 - Some oppose 15th amendment
 - Appealed to ethnic predjuices, saying white women deserved vote more than foreign men
 - Others say 15th amendment is progress, is good

 - 14th and 15th amendments mark significant departure from past
