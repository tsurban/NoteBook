### The Mercantilist System
 - Mercantalism is the mother country thing 
 - The mother countries saw the benefits of mercantalism
 - Government regulates economic activity for benefit of mother country
 - Tactics like:Bounties, Monopolies
 - INCREASE BULLION/WEALTH
 - EXPORTS>INPORTS
 - **Navigation Act** seeks to take control of shipping from dutch, reinforces english mercantalism
 - **Navigation Act** says that many english goods must be shipped and sold in english boats/ports

### The Conquest of New Netherland
 - Restored focus on trade(Royal AFR Company, Amer) with Charels II(restart monarchy 1658)
 - Anglo-dutch war, english get many dutch ports
 - Dutch Surrendered New Netherlands without a fight
 - English transformed base into huge outpost

### New York and the Rights of Englishmen and Englishwomen
 - English rule expanded rights for some, contracted for others
	 - Many concluded that dutch prosperity stem from religious tolerance
	 - Ended Women independence after marry
	 - Women merchants died off after english rule
	 - Restricted black rights
	 - Blacks couldnt work many skiled jobs
	 - gave 2 million acres to 5 favorable families, formed landed aristocracy in america

### New York and the Natives
 - initally, position of iriquois increased
 - formed **Covenant Chain**, a coalition of mutually-benefiting indian tribes and the english
 - Covenant Chain cleared NY of rival tribes and assisted atks on Fr and Natives
 - Eventually Fr Natives banded together and atked the iriquois, forcing them into nutraility, which they've held since

### The Charter of Liberties
 - Colonists started complainig they were denied rights of englishmen like consent to taxation
 - Governers of York had no elected positions or staffers
 - 1683, Duke called elected assembly, drafted Charter of Liberties and Privilages
	 - Elections held each three years(male property owners and freemen)
	 - Reaffirmed trial by jury and security of property
	 - Protestant toleration
 - Partly the new english colonists wanted to assert themselves over the dutch by aligning rules with English rules, not dutch
