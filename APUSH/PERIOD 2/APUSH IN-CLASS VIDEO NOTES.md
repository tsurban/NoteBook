### Why did the british colonies expirenced crisis in the late 17th C.
 - Growing socioeconomic division
	 - Rising elite in NE(NE merchants(participation in trans-atlantic system)/VA planters(sell tobacco to trans-atlantic system))
	 - Still have bible commonwealth NE(property and religious qualifications to vote)
	 - Religious elite shrink because hard to get into church
	 - Larger non-elite population, stabilizes population
		 - Free ppl come with expectation of reciving land(indentured servants, english poor-ish)
		 - Those who have land dont have enough to have benefit from trans-atl sys.
		 - Mercantalisim, naviagion acts
			 - HOW???
 - Unrealized expectation
	 - Many non-elite come
	 - Good land already taken 
 - Concentrated political power
	 - intrests on non-elite not always represented by elite rulers
 - Inequity in Anglo-Native peoples relationship
	 - Some compliant, some resistance
	 - Complex alliances seen in pequot war and covenant chain
