## APUSH The Powhatan 'Uprising' of 1622
***
### The "Massacre of 1622"
 - Typical account
	 - Natives started staying around english houses day before
	 - Account Immediately after says they killed everyone they could reach, sparing nobody, 1/3 of colony 1200 residents killed
	 - History usually says next few years, english counterattacks meant the english kept control of virginia

### Jamestown History recap
 - 1607, sailed, landed on island now called jamestown island
 - Next few years ppl die in droves(disease, natives)
 - Interactions with natives
	 - Landed in middle of huge territory of Powhatan's Regin
	 - Powhatan must have been okay to some extent with their being there
	 - Why War?
		 - John Smith Captured, paraded around, made subordinate chief
		 - Powhatan and English came to understand eachother, went to war(1409-1416)
		 - Powhatan Daughter and John Ralph marry, end war
	 - War start again
		 - Powhatan Daughter died, Powhatan Retire, then 1 year later died
		 - Powhatan give leadership to brother(more harsh)
		 - Jamestown find reason to exist(Tobacco stonks)
		 - Tobacco needs space, english take it from Natives
		 - George Thorpe starts missionary effort(everyone rude to natives)

###The Massacre of 1622
 - Powhatan War real account
	 - New assualt planned, no later than 1621, plans leaked
	 - New leader launches charm campaign
	 - Charm campaign works
	 - March 22, 1622, coordinated atks up and down river
	 - War gives excuse to take more english land
	 - Very few englishmen
	 - They targeted powhatan men and corn
		 - They stole as much corn at harvesttime as possible
		 - They burned the rest
		 - repeat every season
 - Effects
	 - Established english supremacy

### Whats missing from the account
 - Deserves a book
 - Deserves a better name(Massacre not PC, Uprising not accurate(natives not below settlers to start), Coup closest, didnt catch on)
 - March 23rd, they didnt press their advantage, could have won... why?
	 - This was a coup/correctional attack
	 - Wanted to show shouldnt keep moving in geographically
	 - Wanted to show lack of political power
	 - Powhatan way of war different(evolved from only war with other tribes)

### What we know about the powhatan history
 - 1560s, powhatan inherited six subordinate chiefdoms
 - English show up 1607, >30 subordinate chiefs
 - Explains cockiness(of a sort) against english

### What we know about many other Native histories
 - Many natives remember when they werent powhatans
 - Many join for good reasons or for good reasons
 - English found Natives willing to trade them corn to eat on boundary of powhatan region

### How this changes the so what question
 - Recognise that powhatan also colonizing, English now stand alone as colonizer
 - Natives werent vanquished
	 - ppl who had it hardest were core powhantan ppls
	 - Powhatans still far more ppl, same culture
 - Winnners are ppl who agreed to trade corn to english
	 - far enough away not to bae affected by english hooligans
 - Winners are english
	 - Maintained tradition
	 - James river valley much safer
 - Legacy is transformation from jamestown --> virginia
	 - virginia company lost charter
	 - Virginia by the crown established
	 - Wealth consolidated amongst ppl who fought against powhatans
		 - Put in influential government near governer
		 - They gave themselves most share of corn
		 - They used corn to feed selves, servants to grow tobacco
	 - Plantation society damages natives more than war itself
