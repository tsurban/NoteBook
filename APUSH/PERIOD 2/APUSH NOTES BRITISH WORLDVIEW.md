## APUSH NOTES BRITISH WORLDVIEW SHAPES AND CONTRASTS WITH COLONIAL WRLDVW
***
### DUAL IDENTITIES
 - Colonial ppl thought of selves as both British and virginian, or NE, etc
 - Only recently started seeing conflict btw identities
 - Look at how ideas exchange both directions across atl

### British Empire evolving
 - British patriotism
	 - Successful wars with france and spain
	 - dominate transatl system
	 - Colonies fluorishing
	 - Stable government
 - British constitution(four documents that make up the constitution)
	 - Rule of law
		 - Restriction on arbitraty exercise of power
		 - triangle checks to power, written down laws check power
		 - need well defined, established laws
		 - Goal is to apply rule of law equally to everyone(RIP)
	 - Parlimentatry supremacy
		 - parliment can make and unmake any law on behalf of the whole empire or part of the empire(dominion of new england)
		 - Ability to look at wthe whole and know what the parts need
		 - House of lords and House of commons
			 - House of lords is inherited(father->son)
			 - House of commons is elected(represents common person with property)(colonial assemblies as colonial version of HoC)
	 - Representation in gov
		 - House of commons
	 - English Bill of Rights
		 - Trial by Jury

### Liberty and Freedom(Politics and Power)
 - Republican liberty
	 - Republicanism
		 - Economically independent citizens backbone to society
		 - Own own land, own labor(dont work for wage, not in contract where someone else determines if and when to pay you)
	 - Liberalism
		 - John Locke Social Contract
			 - Individual rights, consent of the governed, right of rebellion against opressive government
			 - Nuanced version of moral liberty, rejects natural liberty
			 - Natural rights opened door to marginalized ppl(not locke's intention)
 - Affect on colonies
	 - More ppl in colonial america have suffrage than in england
		 - Property qualifications
		 - NO religious qualifications(ended with DNE)
		 - Idea that ppl who have land need to have say in government because they have economic stake and government has more of an effect on them
		 - More ppl own property, can vote in america than england
	 - Salutory neglect
		 - Law exist regarding what colonists can do(politics economics social)(think nav acts)
		 - Parlimentary supremacy not enforced
		 - Laws NOT ENFORCED = SALUATORY NEGLEECT
		 - Colonial assemblies claimed equality with house of commons
		 - appointive v elected power
		 - Creates false sense of having control, parliment could eliminate saluatory neglect on a whim
		 - Removal of salutory neglect causes Amerev
	 - Public Sphere 
		 - Ability for commoners to talk about, have opinions on politics
		 - False sense that Public sphere is limitless
		 - Clubs, like junto
		 - Colonial press
	 - Limits of free speech
		 - Zenger trial

### Great awakening
 - Whitefield + edwards
 - reenthusiasation of religion
 - protestant uptick
