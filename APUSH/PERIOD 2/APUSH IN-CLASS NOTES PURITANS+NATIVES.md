## APUSH IN-CLASS NOTES PURITANS+NATIVES
***
### Challenges to holy expirement
 - Political
	 - Bible Commonwealth
		 - true religious freedom(Y/N)
		 - separation of church and state
			 - degree to which seperated
			 - some want no religious requirement for gov participation(including voting)
		 - Consolidation of power amongst ministers and magistrates
			 - Tried to get away from this in England, reproduced it in New England
			 - What they are actually trying to change is they want to be at the top rather than the bottom
 - Theological
	 - Concept of "Chosen" and divine mission
		 - Puritans are "chosen" and settling North America is divine mission
		 - **Roger Williams** pushes back on this, thinks god made everyone equal
	 - Devaluing **Covenant of Grace**(soul saved bc of gods grace)
		 - This SHOULD mean that your status as elect or not dosent affect if u are saved.  
		 - As N.E. Settles, hierarchy forms, ways to "prove" that you are saved like donating and attending church
		 - **Anne Hutchinson** says this is wrong, this departs from covenant of grace
		 - Recreating traditional english practices
 - Social
	 - Gender equality
		 - Equal religiously, not socailly
		 - Anne hutchinson dosent agree with this
	 - Small percentage of ppl hold large amount of power
	 - Winthrops and Mathers all leadership roles
		 - All elected, but still feels hereditary
		 - Recreating heriditary rule of england
		 - Bad bc lose touch, talent
	 - Economic inequality

### What did Anne Hutchinson and Roger williams tell us
 - Diversity of thought in N.E. 
	 - Form other states like conneticut, Rhode Island, new hampshire, etc
	 - Different levels of vulnerability
		 - Dissenters don't always get significant retributon
		 - Amassing a following very dangerous, makes leader of following more vulnerable to retribution from state bc they rely on their following more
 - Self governing, autonomous towns
 - Overarching governing authority
 - Massive leway between colonies, punishment differs based on local law
	 - Depends on stability of towns
	 - Depends on different standards
 - Anne Hutchinson extra concerning because women represent sin/devils tool, so if a sin person gets a following, that makes the following concerning
 - Corporal punishment reserved for special circumstances
	 - Anne Hutchinson protected by powerful family
	 - Persuasion, Arbitration, Community Pressures all come as steps before corporal punishment
 - Puritan Mission goals unrealized
	 - Halfway Covenant(previously must be Baptized, Church attendance, Conversion Narritive)
	 - Halfway, dont need Conv. Narr.
	 - 
 - More Freedom moving west(dissenters leave boston, usually go west)
 - More vulnerable/must be more self-reliant West

### What do the interactions between Puritans and Natives tell us about New England's settler society
 - Very motivated about mission(mission on hill, light out of darkness)
	 - Power/control over own language to express natives beliefs to english in terms that make out the native religion as bad
 - Fear underlines everything(not understanding)
 - English settlement unstoppable, settle deeper and deeper west
	 - Clear puropse
	 - Bible commonwealth
 - Diversity of thought towards natives
	 - Winthrop -- cant coexist, english must win out
	 - Williams -- Need recognise Soverignty, Need exchange land and goods
 - Treat Natives diff from other euro settlers(more violent to natives)
