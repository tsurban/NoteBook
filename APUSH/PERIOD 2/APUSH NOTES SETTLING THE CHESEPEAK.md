## APUSH Settling the Cheesepeak
***
### Virgina Company --> Virginia Society!!
 - Started off searching for gold
 - Not much gold, not sustainable
 - Needed to start farming to sustain, find new "marketable commodity", attract settlers
 - 1618, policies to shift to society
	 - Headright system = 50 free acres to anyone who pays for themself or another to come to Amer(including servants)
	 - **Charter of Grants and Liberties**
		 - New gov
		 - **House of Burgesses, first elected assembly(1619)**
		 - Only freemen vote
		 - Appointed governer can full veto
	 - Layed foundation for slaves and stuff

### Powhatan and Pocahahontas
 - Jamestown inhabitated by 15-25000 natives
 - Wahunsonacock leader(powhatan by english)
 - Virginia company instructed settlers to be nice to natives(las casas warning)
 - Mostly peceful for 2 years
	 - John smith captured, threatened execution by powhatan
	 - Rescued by pocahontas(Favorite child of powhatan)
	 - Likely ploy by powhatan to show his power
 - Trade resumes, pocahontas is intermediary
 - John smith leaves, peace fails
 - Settlers attack natives, capture, convert, marry pocahontas

 ### Uprising of 1622
 
  - Once natives realized english were trying to settle, conflict inevitable
  - Powhatan successor(brother) suprise attack, kill 25% virginia whites
  - Remaining colonists massacre many natives
  - Unsuccessful uprising means settler supremacy
  - Repeat events 1644
  - Forced treaty, forced move west
 
 ### TOBACCO!!!!!
  - King James I considered tobacco BAD FOR YOU
  - Many english still smoke(Some as medicine...?)
  - Good business, taxes good for king
  - Get rich quick
  - Need labor(young indentured servants)
  - Whites grew in power while servant numbers grow
 ### Women and Family
  - Virginia lacked stable family life
  - Men needed more as servants
  - Men to Women 5:1
  - Patriarchal ideas strong, practice weak
  - **Dower Rights**
	  - Wife gets 1/3 husbands property if he dies
	  - If wife dies, passes to male heirs
  - Most women work and die in fields
  - Some women(not married) get farms and are independent(Margaret Bent)

### The Maryland Experiment
 - Maryland followed similar course to virginia(including tobacco dominance)
  - Grant of land to single individual(**Proprietary colony**), Cecilius Calvert
  - Clavert had "full, free, absolute power over everything"
  - Elected assembly must aprove his things
  - Land layed out in manors, tribute payed to Calvert
  - Garunteed all rights of englishmen
  - Religion
	  - Calvert == catholic
	  - Hoped protestants and cathloics live in hamony
	  - Most of higherups in gov/land owners were catholic
	  - Majority of settlers protestants
	  - Death rate high, same family stuff in virginia
	  - Easier for servants to get land
	  - Got harder over time
