## APUSH NOTES Social Classes in Colonial America
***
### The colonial elite
 - Wealth gap growing fast
 - elites not as powerful as elites in england
 - Upper class is merchants linked to trading firms in england
 - No banks, so credit and cash in short supply, so you need connections as wel as money
 - 1750, chesepeake and lower south dominated by plantations of staple crops that everyone needs
 - Elites also included powerful political appointments
 - upper class in virginia known as 'cousinocray'
 - Elites control governing bodies of anglican chuch, county courts, and virginia legislature
 - planters pass wealth to next generation
 - self-made ppl had no chance of gentryship

### New world Cultures
 - No true american identity before revolution("american" = native)
 - Many immigrants kept traditions going, intermarrage prevents unified identity
 - English viewed colonists as convicts, dissidents, poor servants
 - This view means that colonists redouble their english assrtions
 - Whites saw selves as no need to be governed, thought natives and slaves needed to be governed
 - defined by opposition to others, like spanish, french, catholics, africans, natives

### Anglicianization
 - Elites had more contact with english than amongst selves
 - They all slowly became more english
 - Tried to demonstrate status by emulating england, made them feel less isolated
 - Many planters fell into debt trying to keep up appearences

### South Carolina Aristocracy
 - richest planters were in SC
 - very large wealth gap
 - lived lavish lives
 - Saw society as hiererchal, where some men meant to rule
 - Liberty for the rich to dominate
 - Freedom from labor is mark of a gentlemen

### Poverty in the colonies
 - Poverty increased
	 - Growing numbers of slaves impoverished conditions
	 - Freepeople, poverty not as bad as in England
	 - PPl increase, finding limits to land
 - Better-off ppl think of impoverished as lazy, responsible for own plight
 - Authorities would try to keep unwanted poor out

### Middle ranks
 - Vast majority colonists in middle btw rich and poor
 - little farmers make up considerable part(2/3 free white male)
 - land ownership viewed as a right/social pronounciation of freedom

### Women and household economy
 - family center of econ. life
 - most work revolved around home/farm
 - Farmers grew food for family first, export second
 - as colonies stabilized, oppurtunities for women fade
 - women had no representation in court because couldnt act as own laywer
 - "Women's Jobs" just got harder

### Opportunities for freedom
 - large diversity of ppls
 - many colonists enjoyed more freedom(vote, land, worship)
