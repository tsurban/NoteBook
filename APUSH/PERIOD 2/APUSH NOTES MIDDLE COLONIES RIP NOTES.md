## APUSH NOTES Middle Colonies RIP
***
### ABSTRACT
 - Seek to define the middle colonies as pluralist
 - Hard to do this because threre are too many different POVs
 - Others seek to define as relates to atlantic trade
 - Idea that middle colonies were united is largely unexplored

### Middle Atlantic Definition
 - Many see only as a vague geographical term to describe the land between NE and Vir
 - Middle colonies ripe for observation of civilization forming with "social diversity and ethnic-religious pluralism"
 - politics very localized, intrests of each group prioritized
 - no coherent regional politics
 - Some seek to define by produce(foodstuffs), but there is a wide variety of different foodstuffs being mads
 - Some say define as interactive behaviors in locus
	 - founding of midatlantic locus with NY est after Duke of York took from DWIC
	 - DWIC more accepting, mixed, gives idea of pluralisim, DWIC trade with iriquois est. far inland trade networks
	 - PA established by king james bro for will penn
	 - Economic, political boundaries not enough to define pluralism still
 - The above fails when see disorder even in early formation
 - View from an atlantic standpoint
	 - see a common zone of exchange
	 - important to see from outside of america
	 - fails when you see that the groups did break off and spread outside of mid-atlantic
 - View from a cis-atlantic standpoint
	 - observe individual interactions with the atlantic, then see how they connext
	 - This approach ignores the factors that make these places different from britan
	 - this gives bermuda more claim to mid-atlantic
 - View from natives standpoint
	 - Really depends on which aspect of native life u look at
	 - Dosent help to merge continental and atlantic lenses

### THE AUTHORS DEFINITION

 - The dutch define early settlement throught colonies
	 - Slaves to the chesepeake, north
	 - Dutch ships export the goods produced by colonies
	 - Colonists, including NE new this
	 - Dispute over trade posts helps start pequot war
 - Natives reach to amongst all colonies too
	 - Many different relationships between many different tribes between many different peoples
	 - These interactions lead to bacons rebellion
 - Nobody thinks anymore that it is as simple as puritams and adventurers or religion and profit, now realize more in the MIDDLE
	 - PA also has religious zeal
	 - Virginia had some religious orgins too
 - When viewed from ATL lens, destinctions btw NE and CHESP blur
 - the uncertainty of MID not unique
 - MID had little differentiating it from the others, thus didnt exist as own entity.


### Characterizations at the time

 - One thought middle colonies include everywhere but NE and including the "Confederate Indians[sic]"
 - others think RI, Maine, Jersys aremiddle stuff
 - Many think that NY nor in middle colonies
 - 1982, Michael Zuckerman declares PA, NJ, NY similar in their pluralisim, religious liberty, partisanship, and legitimate self intrest
 - He also thought middle colonies emulated the rest of america that they didnt really need thir own history other than representing diversity... others look to them to see what is truly american


### MELTING POT?
 - many characterize region with the faliure of pluralism and the unsatisfaction of compromise(of the quakers)
 - other argue not really melting pot; just many seperate groups
 - social hierarchy that made it hard to tell where you or others fit in
 - places where the groups were crossing had serious quarrels
	 - distrust, massacre of free africans after fires in NY
	 - Carslile had small mixing(contested by many), was disorderly
	- phily similar
- Some see anglicanization in mid-atlantic as well as elsewhere(also see middle colonies as following chesepeake pattern)

### Why need to define?
 - understand forces behind seven years' war
	 - History behind this is gone now
 - understand what is american
