### American Freedom gets Narrowed further
 - already narrowed for freedppl+industrial workers+farmers
 - Nativism and Exclusion
	 - Significant tension around american identity
	 - New Immigration and new Nativism
	 - Americanism is 
		 - anglosaxan protestantism
		 - having skills used to make money
		 - Immigrants come from southern+eastern europe+try to come from asia
			 - majorities are afraid bc immigrants are different(cultural identity and values) than them
			 - Seen as distinct races of a lower level/no self-respect
			 - Racial Nationalism(grounds america in anglosaxan tradition)
			 - Develops bc of social darwinism+gospel
		 - Asians on RR and in mines encouraged to come
		 - Massive cultural misunderstanding
			 - 'Gangs' of workers collaborate leader gets the pay for all, etc, americans wonder why you would collaborate like that
			 - Contine to wear clothing and hair w/culture
			 - Many chinese are vegetarian
			 - Able to work for lower wages
		 - Pushes(Econ depression, Gov opression, Lack of opportunity, environmental factors)
		 - Pulls(Abundance of opportunity, better economy, perception of stability)
	 - Cginese Exclusion and chinese rights(angel Island, paper families)
	 - Asians excluded from citizenship just like blacks and natives
		 - page act(Families coming in IR, intend to settle permenantly, bars chinese women into country unless have family here)
			 - Paper families subvert this, agents buy family details and give them to ppl in china to come over
			 - pretty effective, esp after SF earthquake which destroyed all reccords
		 - Immigration processing centers in ellis+angel island
			 - Questions asked at ellis island are of age, where from, politics, etc, family, job(all happens in a day)
			 - Questons asked at angel takes way longer, you are grilled on your family, all info is crosschecked with paper family, write poetry on the wall, captures expirence at angel, hope for future, warnings, etc
