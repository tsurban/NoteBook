### Rhetoric
 - Rhetoric is not nessecrily trickery
 - Rhetoric = *The faculty of observing in any given case the avalible means of persuasion*
 - Rhetoric leads to effetive communication to appeal to an audience
	 - Resolve conflicts
	 - Persuade readers to a position
	 - Convince to take action
 - Rhetoric is useful for persuasion in any form
 - Rhetoric must be comprehended to see past rhetoric appeals to the substantive part
	 - This is useful for informed citizenship
	 - Good for identifying misinformation and propoganda
	 - Good for CREATING arguments

### Occasion, Context, Purpose
 - Rhetoric is situational/influenced by historical, cultural, social mvmnts of the time(*Context*)
 - Rhetoric is informed by *occasion* - circumstances, atomosphere, attitudes, events surrounding witing
	 - Occasion gives rise to reason for writing
	 - Sometimes occasion is clear, sometimes speaker must declare or convince audience of occasion
 - *Purpose* is the goal sought to achieve

### The Rhetorical Triangle
 - Speaker is author/deliverer of text and who they are
	 - Consider their persona
 - Audience is the consumer of the text
	 - May be multiple audiences
	 - May be unintentional audiences
 - Subject is the topic(not purpose/goal)
	 - 

### Rhetorical Appeals - Ethos, Logos, Pathos
 - Ethos
	 - Automatic ethos is when speaker's reputation establishes ethos by itself(King George)
	 - Building ethos by explaining your background/credentials/shared values
 - Logos
	 - Clear Rational ideas
	 - Clear main idea backed up with details/examples/facts/stats/expert testimony
	 - Define terms of argument+Make connections
	 - Conceding and Refuting
		 - *CounterArgument* appeals to logos
		 - Concession + Refutation shows you understand other points but still support your own point
 - Pathos
	 - Appeal to emotions, values, desires, hopes, fears, prejudices
	 - Propagandistic and Polemical(agressive/assert dominance/dont concede other point)
	 - Use connotations of words
 - Combining the three
	 - All are intertwined/ ethos+logos, ethos+pathos, pathos+logos

### Taking Rhetorical risks
 - How do we know what the right rhetorical strategy to take is
 - Humor/satire
	 - Can effectively appeal to pathos
	 - Can make a point without preaching to audience or being to serious
	 - Balance btw mockery
