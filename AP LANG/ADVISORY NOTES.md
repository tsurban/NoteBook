ADVISORY NOTES

 - PPL at the capitol for what they viewed as an injustuce
	 - Veryviolent
	 - THEY WRONG
 - Always a cause deeply cared about
 - Response is porportinal to percieved threat of the injustice
 - Proclaimed goals are always to right the injustice, though this is unfailingly overshadowed by individual interests
 - I think that the percieved threat of the injustice and the value of what is threatened by the injustice to the individuals gets larger
 - Nonviolent protest can be effective, though usually only when the protest can affect the lives of the changemakers directly
	 - Womens suffrage+the war+picket line
	 - White society has distanced itself enough from black society that this is harder/impossible to acheive with nonviolence
 -
