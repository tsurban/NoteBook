## APLANG Synthesis
***
### What is synthesis
 - Combining sources to form a position
 - Your position needent be a contest
	 - Must consult sources, seek complexity
	 - Acknowledge bias in others(personal gain, )
	 - Look at it as a range of viewpoints rather than pro/con polarization

### Approaching Sources
 - Must have an open mind when starting reading a source
	 - The dobuting game vs the believing game
	 - Dobuting game
		 - Skeptical, analytic with each idea
		 - Discover contradictions, poor reasoning, other problems
		 - May miss chance to fully understand an idea
	 - Believing game
		 - trying to be as welcoming as possible to every idea
		 - Not just hearing to be able to refute
		 - Allows to find virtue in others ideas and flaws in our own
	 - Use both

### Using Sources
 - To Inform an Argument
	 - Sources should enhance, not replace argument
	 - Sources inform your views, dont make them up, your position matters
	 - Never allow sources to overwhelm original ideas
 - To Appeal to an Audience
	 - Rhetorical situation determines what is appropriate to cite sources
	 - Different types of sources for different audiences
