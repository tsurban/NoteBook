APCSA TEST 4 notes

 - if/else/else if, for, while = control structures/alter normal flow of program
 - While
	 - Init before
	 - Test during
	 - Update if true
	 - if while loop is infinite x=1 (x<0) x++, ends with x = Integer.MIN_VALUE
	 - Cumulative sum - variable keeping sum in progress
 - Extracting digits from INT(get digit with %10, then /=10, repeat)(use while number != 0)
 - Types of loops: Indefinite(while) Definite(For)
 - For
	 - (Init; Test; Update){}
	 - Update happens at end of exec
	 - Init var called loop counter
	 - breaks stop exec
 - String stuff
	 - Can also use charAt rather than substring(i,i+1)
 - <code>Largest - Smallest + 1</code>
