APCSA TEST 5

 - Declaration: Line that declares a class
	```
	public class ClassName{}
	```
 - Create object of class with
   ```
   ClassName objectname = new ClassName(Actual Paramaters);
   ```
 - Constructor returns new object being created
 - Modularity: methods in smaller tasks that could be reorganized to perform different functions
 - *"static: Part of a class, rather than part of an object. Not copied into each object; shared by all objects of that class. Static methods are called using the dot operator along with the class name **unless they are defined in the enclosing class**."* -- What does this mean
 - Shadowing:2 variables with same name in same scope, closer/more local scoped var wins
 - ```this``` keyword refers to class-level scope always
 - Static methods dont have a ```this`` reference
